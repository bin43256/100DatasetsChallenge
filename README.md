# Data Analysis Challenges

This repository contains a set of data analysis projects where I demonstrate various data processing and visualization techniques to discover insights from different datasets.

## Data Source

Most of the datasets in this repository come from Arlington County's open-source data hub. These datasets are primarily flat files (e.g., `.json`, `.csv`), and they can be found in the `Data Source` directory. Additionally, one project utilizes data pulled from a public API.

## Language and Tools

All project files are Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`). The primary Python packages used for data processing and visualization are:

- **Pandas**: For data processing and manipulation
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced statistical data visualization

## Project Table of Contents
### 1. Arlington Property Sale
   This project analyzes historical property sale data in Arlington. The dataset includes information about property sales, including property codes, sale amounts, and more.
### 2. Building Energy
   This project focuses on analyzing energy usage data for buildings. The dataset contains information about energy consumption (electricity and natural gas), building floor area, and more.
### 3. Capital Project
   This analysis looks at Arlington's newly listed and updated capital projects, including budget, status, and project details.
### 4. Electric Vehicle
   This project analyzes Electric Vehicles(EVs) data,including the distribution of vehicle types, states with the highest number of electric vehicles, correlations between electric range and MSRP, and the most expensive vehicles by city and car make.
