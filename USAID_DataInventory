The USAID/Malawi funded program was implemented starting August of 2013, by RTI (Research Triangle Institute) International. The MEGRA educational program was implemented alongside a Feed the Future project called Integrating Nutrition in Value Chains (INVC) and a Global Health Initiative project called Support for Service Delivery Integration (SSDI), both of which were also expected to affect the success of learners in school. Through this interconnected strategy, USAID/Malawi aimed to have a greater impact on outcomes of interest (such as learning reading scores) than would otherwise be possible through one project alone. The key elements of the MEGRA reading intervention involved:

•	Conduct teacher training, including practicums

•	Provide scripted lesson plans to teachers

•	Provide in-service teacher support and mentoring (or coaching)

•	Provide rewards for high-performing teachers and schools

•	Develop and distribute books, story cards, letter cards, and bookshelves

•	Organize reading fairs and other events to engage parents, caregivers, and the community in learner learning

•	Invite parents to participate in their learners’ classrooms and/or become engaged in extracurricular activities

•	Ensure a supportive policy environment by attending the Basic Education Technical Working Group and writing Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) to gain necessary Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology(MoEST) support and buy-in

•	Facilitate the extension of school instructional time

In order to test possible complementary or multiplier effects of the MEGRA reading intervention and the INVC and SSDI activities, all three interventions were implemented in and evaluated for four distinct treatment levels:

•	Treatment Level 1: Three focus districts (Balaka, Machinga, and Lilongwe Rural) that provide an opportunity to evaluate the impact of a fully-integrated development approach with multiple activities across sectors, including MEGRA, INVC, and SSDI, on early grade reading outcomes.

•	Treatment Level 2: The district (Salima) where MEGRA overlaps with only the SSDI intervention. This serves as a test ground for the hypothesis that synergies between education and health initiatives catalyze changes that are greater than the sum of their parts.

•	Treatment Level 3: The district (Ntcheu) where MEGRA overlaps with only the INVC intervention. This serves as a test ground for the development hypothesis that synergies between education and agricultural livelihood and nutrition initiatives catalyze changes that are greater than the sum of their parts.

•	Treatment Level 4: Five districts (Blantyre Rural, Mzimba North, Ntchisi, Thyolo, and Zomba Rural) that only receive the MEGRA initiative. These districts are used to test the MEGRA theory of change that education support leads to improved literacy and general education outcomes.

MEGRA was implemented at the zonal level, at baseline in 2013, where zones were randomly selected in each of the four levels to implement the MEGRA intervention (taking into account areas where INVC and SSDI were already working). However, since INVC and SSDI were not randomly assigned at baseline, the evaluation can only be able to determine whether EGRA is better than no EGRA and whether EGRA plus INVC and SSDI is better than no treatment.

While MEGRA expected to include both treatment and comparison schools in each district at each level, at baseline, it was unable to because the SSDI and INVC activities were already underway. As such, the program found that in the Level 2 district, Salima, it was impossible to select comparison zones that were not already contaminated with the SSDI intervention because SSDI was already work",Early Grade Reading Activity Malawi 2015 EGRA Midline,['184:020'],http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/legalcode,['Basic Education'],vcard:Contact,Lena Knezevic,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,"['https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/23jf-ca8a/files/c6bebb47-0fe3-43fb-a671-5af8fe7f69e3', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/23jf-ca8a/files/55588a12-7a56-4b9f-bcd4-25acf8fbebe2']",https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/23jf-ca8a/files/71783a5e-12e3-4808-832a-c00ae4814067,,,,3,,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/23jf-ca8a/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/23jf-ca8a/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/23jf-ca8a/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/23jf-ca8a/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD,,,,,,

The test organisms were E. coli and the Ebola surrogate Phi6. All tests achieved a minimum of 5.9­ and 3.1­log removal in E. coli and Phi6, respectively. A 15­-minute exposure to 0.5% chlorine was sufficient to ensure less than 8 Phi6 PFU/cm2 in all tests. While chlorine types were equally efficacious with and without soil load, variation was seen by surface type. Wiping did not increase disinfection efficacy, and is not recommended as it generates infectious waste. Covering spills decreased disinfection efficacy against E. coli on heavy ­duty tarp but does prevent splashing, which is critical in Ebola contexts. Our results support the recommendation of a 15-minute exposure to 0.5% chlorine, independently of chlorine type, surface, pre­-cleaning practices, and organic matter, as an efficacious measure to interrupt disease transmission from uncontrolled spills in Ebola outbreaks.",Data for Efficacy of Nitrile Disinfection (Phi6),['184:034'],,['Other Public Health Threats'],vcard:Contact,Lena Knezevic,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/hjah-22yn/files/8d42130b-4f16-47cd-aac7-b641381f1863,,,,5,,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/25ct-yrbs/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/25ct-yrbs/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/25ct-yrbs/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/25ct-yrbs/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD,,,,,,

The purpose of this evaluation of the Social Enterprise Boost Initiative (SEBI) is to determine whether the SEBI activity achieved its objectives and gain lessons for implementation of ongoing or future programs. The evaluation sought to identify: 1) implementation challenges, corrective actions to project management, and progress towards achieving expected results; 2) the factors that contributed to the success/failure of the different project components; 3) the effect of the activity on men and women; and 4) the extent to which SEBI contributed to the local social enterprise (SE) policy environment. The evaluation will serve to inform the United States Agency for International Development Jamaica Mission’s (USAID/Jamaica) Local Partner Development (LPD) program under the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) as well as the Social Enterprise Jamaica (SEJA), which is in the process of being registered as a non-governmental organization (NGO), with a view to continuing some of the work of SEBI once the project ends in December 2018. The exact nature of SEJA’s activities is unclear, although the Evaluation Team (ET) understands that the focus could primarily be on incubation services for SEs under the LPD program.

SEBI was initiated by the Jamaica National Foundation (JNF) and jointly funded by JNF and USAID. The rationale for USAID’s decision to support SEBI in Jamaica, implemented by (JNF), was based on several important factors at the time, namely: 1) low levels of business competitiveness and productivity; 2) a stagnant economy; 3) a high debt burden; and 4) high levels of crime in the country. The genesis of SEBI was in JNF’s observation that not-for-profit and other organizations operating in the social sector were struggling to deliver their core services mainly due to a reliance on grants and donations. The underlying goal therefore was to introduce the social enterprise model to these organizations so that they could start generating their own income and become less reliant on grants and donations. SEBI began in July 2012 and is due for completion at the end of December 2018, following three extensions agreed in Modifications 2, 3, and 5 in the Cooperative Agreement (CA). 

The ET pursued three separate, yet interlinked, data collection activities that formed the basis of its methodological approach to conducting the SEBI evaluation as follows:
1.	Face-to-face meetings on site with SEBI’s incubator and accelerator beneficiary clients as well as representatives from key stakeholders,  including national and local government, the private sector, international community, civil society, NGOs, and business associations and agencies. In total, the ET met with 29 beneficiaries (20 incubators and 13 accelerators) and 30 stakeholders. Team members used semi-structured questionnaires to record answers for later comparative analysis and cross-reference purposes with findings from the other data collection methods, mentioned below. 
2.	The ET hosted four focus group discussions (FGDs) in the parishes (Trelawny, St. James, Westmoreland and Manchester) and one in Kingston with selected groups of SEBI indirect beneficiaries. In total, 31 participants attended the FGDs, providing views and responses to questions which were noted for later cross-referencing with findings from the direct beneficiary and public awareness surveys. 
3.	Two surveys were carried out by Market Research Services Limited (MRSL), based in Kingston, on behalf of the ET (see Annex 6 – Survey Reports for complete analysis of the findings from both surveys). Final Performance Evaluation of the USAID/Jamaica Social Enterprise Boost Initiative (SEBI)

Color has been studied in numerous crop species and has often been linked to loci controlling the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. This study makes use of available resources, including mapping populations, a reference genome, and a high-density single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping platform, to map the black seed coat and purple pod tip color traits, with the gene symbol Bl, in cowpea. Several gene models encoding MYB domain protein 113 were identified as candidate genes. MYB domain proteins have been shown in other species to control expression of genes encoding enzymes for the final steps in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. PCR analysis indicated that a presence/absence variation of one or more MYB113 genes may control the presence or absence of black pigment.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the safety and immunogenicity of RVF virus (RVFV) mutagenesis passage 12 (MP-12) and arMP-12ΔNSm21/384 vaccine candidates in goats (Capra aegagrus hircus) in Tanzania. Goats were vaccinated intramuscularly with RVFV MP-12 or arMP-12ΔNSm21/384, and then on Day 87 post-vaccination (PV) all animals were revaccinated using the RVFV MP-12 vaccine candidate. Serum samples were collected from the animals before and after vaccination at various intervals to test for RVFV using a Vero cell culture assay and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and for RVFV-neutralising antibody using a plaque reduction neutralisation assay. Serum samples collected before vaccination on Days -14 and 0, and on Days 3, 4 and 5 PV were negative for RVFV and neutralising antibody. All animals remained healthy, and viremia was not detected in any of the animals. Rift Valley fever virus antibody was first detected on Day 5 PV at a 1:10 dilution in five of five animals vaccinated with the MP-12 vaccine and in five of eight animals vaccinated with arMP-12ΔNSm21/384. Titres then increased and were sustained at 1:40 to 1:640 through to Day 87 PV. All animals that were revaccinated on Day 87 PV with MP-12 developed antibody titres ranging from 1:160 to as high as 1:10 240 on Days 14 and 21 PV.

It is also the only one to date subjected to peer review; in addition, three peer review papers for publication in leading journals and a presentation for the 2015 annual conference of the American Evaluation Association are in preparation. This MISTI survey data file contains the combined response data from five semi-annual iterations or “waves” of surveys conducted from September 2012 through November 2014 to determine whether USAID project activities caused changes in stability and resilience at the district and village levels.At the start, MISTI compiled a baseline stabilization and impact evaluation and survey. For the five waves of surveys, each of which was conducted over several months, a total of 190,264 individual interviews were undertaken in 5,093 different villages across 130 districts of the 23 provinces where stabilization initiatives were being implemented or considered. These data were compiled into one file to facilitate easy access for international development practitioners, researchers and other interested parties in accordance with the USAID’s Open Data Policy. As part of this process, village names and locations have been replaced with unique village identifiers to ensure the safety of Afghan stakeholders. This preserves a researcher's ability to access granular data and see trends at the village-level, but prevents data consumers from attributing responses to a named Afghan village.The datasets supplied here are in CSV format. In addition to the response-level dataset (MISTI_Survey_Data), we are providing a village-level dataset (MISTI_Village_Data). Each row of this dataset contains data from one unique village surveyed by MISTI in Waves 1-5. The dataset is in wide format. Each variable is identified by a wave number and a proximity to the village.  Data include village demographic characteristics, violent incident counts, stabilization and NSP project activities, and perception indicators from individual survey interviews aggregated to the village mean. These data were analyzed for the MISTI impact evaluation of USAID stabilization programming in Afghanistan, 2012-2014.Codebooks are supplied for each dataset as is the final survey instrument used.

These indicators reflect data collected through population-based surveys (PBS) in the geographic areas targeted by Feed the Future interventions, known as the Feed the Future Zones of Influence (ZOI). The northern Kenya ZOI is comprised of five counties: Marsabit, Garissa, Isiolo, Wajir, and Turkana. Of these, only three counties (Marsabit, Isiolo, and Turkana) were included in the baseline survey. Garissa and Wajir were inaccessible during the baseline because of security issues. Feed the Future REGAL-IR programming covers all five counties of the ZOI, while REGAL-AG covers Marsabit and Isiolo. Differences in the values of indicators can be compared by the intensity of the program (REGAL-IR only versus REGAL-IR plus REGAL-AG) in the REGAL IE report. Kimetrica, Westat's subcontractor in northern Kenya, interviewed eligible respondents in a total of 1,837 households in nine counties (Garissa, Isiolo, Marsabit, Turkana, Wajir, Baringo, Mandera, Samburu, and Tana River). Data collection took place from 14 May to 13 June 2015. The sample is large enough to measure differences among intensity levels of REGAL and humanitarian assistance (HA) programming for the IE, as well as provide point estimates for Feed the Future indicators at the ZOI level. This interim assessment uses data from 1,193 households in the five counties of the ZOI (Garissa, Isiolo, Marsabit, Turkana, and Wajir).

Seed size varies widely among different cowpea accessions, and the genetic basis of such variation is not yet well understood. To better decipher the genetic basis of seed size, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and meta-analysis were conducted on a panel of 368 cowpea diverse accessions from 51 countries. Four traits, including seed weight, length, width and density were evaluated across three locations. Using 51,128 single nucleotide polymorphisms covering the cowpea genome, 17 loci were identified for these traits. One locus was common to weight, width and length, suggesting pleiotropy. By integrating synteny-based analysis with common bean, six candidate genes (Vigun05g036000, Vigun05g039600, Vigun05g204200, Vigun08g217000, Vigun11g187000, and Vigun11g191300) which are implicated in multiple functional categories related to seed size such as endosperm development, embryo development, and cell elongation were identified. These results suggest that a combination of GWAS meta-analysis with synteny comparison in a related plant is an efficient approach to identify candidate gene (s) for complex traits in cowpea.

The overarching goal of LTTP II is to enhance pupils' learning in general, and reading proficiency in particular; establish a functional teacher professional development (PD) system; and strengthen the MOEs capacity to manage such a system. The LTTP II was originally designed to work in nine counties: Grand Gedeh, Grand Kru, Lofa, Maryland, Montserrado, Nimba, River Cess, River Gee, and Sinoe. In 2011 and 2012, because of changes in USAID policies, the number of counties was reduced to five (i.e., Bong, Lofa, Margibi, Montserrado, and Nimba), which USAID identifies as a development corridor, containing a majority of the Liberian population.

The LTTP II intervention drew on the EGRA Plus model to introduce similarly structured reading and math programs in grades 1, 2, and 3 to approximately 1,020 schools in four counties (i.e., Bong, Lofa, Montserrado, and Nimba) in a phased approach. Cohort 1, the first to receive support, had 792 schools. During the middle of the 2011/2012 school year, the reading program was introduced in all three grades in these schools. During the middle of the 2012/2013 school year, the mathematics program was introduced in all three grades. Cohort 2, consisting of approximately 330 schools, began participating in the programs reading and mathematics interventions during the 2013/2014 school year and continued during the 2014/2015 school year. Some changes, although not significant, were made to the intervention approach for supporting the Cohort 2 schools.

Schools in the four LTTP II counties were randomly assigned to the Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 groupings. These schools were then grouped in clusters of 12 schools based on geographic proximity, which would allow the program to deliver the interventions more efficiently

Cohort 1: Schools from the four target counties included in Cohort 1 served as the treatment group for the midterm assessment. These schools stopped receiving LTTP II support after the midterm assessment, but they participated in the endline assessment, as a way to determine whether the gains that were achieved during the treatment were sustained.

Cohort 2: Schools included in Cohort 2 in the same four counties began to receive treatment after the midterm assessmentthus, during the final two years of the program. Cohort 2 schools served as a control to which the Cohort 1 results were compared. The performance of Cohort 2 schools were to be compared to that of Cohort 1. The biggest challenge that the program faced regarding the implementation in Cohort 2 schools was the school closings because of the Ebola crisis. Schools were closed between September 2014 and February 2015. Even after the official reopening date, with the gradual actual opening of schools that required LTTP II to wait until schools were safe to open, it took several months to distribute books to schools and to train teachers which in turn severely affected the implementation of the treatment.

External Cohort: A randomly selected sample of schools outside the four target counties served as another comparator, especially after Cohort 2 began receiving treatment alongside Cohort 1.

Except for a small number of schools associated with the RTTIs, schools outside the four target counties did not participate in the program during the lifetime of LTTP II.

The scores and rankings of the eight factors and 44 sub-factors of the Index draw from two sources of data collected by the WJP: 1) A General Population Poll (GPP) conducted by leading local polling companies, using a representative sample of 1,000 respondents in each country and jurisdiction; and 2) Qualified Respondents’ Questionnaires (QRQs) consisting of closed-ended questions completed by in-country legal practitioners, experts, and academics with expertise in civil and commercial law; constitutional law, civil liberties, and criminal law; labor law; and public health. These two data sources provide current, original information reflecting the experiences and perceptions of the general public and in-country legal practitioners and experts in 126 countries and jurisdictions worldwide. 

The QRQs were conducted for the WJP Rule of Law Index® 2019 by the WJP’s research team based in Washington, DC. The surveys were administered online from May 2018 through early November 2018. In total, 27 expert practitioners completed the QRQs in Mali, and 13 expert practitioners completed the QRQs in Niger.

The GPP in Mali was conducted for the WJP Rule of Law Index with sampling, framework, and data processing by Marketing Support consultancy Limited based in Accra, Ghana. The survey fieldwork was conducted face-to-face between October 15th and November 30th, 2018, using a multi-stage, stratified, area cluster probability sampling design. The target population for this survey was Malians, 18 years of age or older, living in the regions of Bamako, Koulikoro, Mopti, Sikasso, and Tombouctou. The achieved sample size was 1,012 interviews distributed proportionally throughout the regions of Bamako, Koulikoro, Mopti, Sikasso, and Tombouctou. The sample was proportionally stratified by urbanization, gender, age, and socioeconomic status.

The GPP in Niger was conducted for the WJP Rule of Law Index with sampling, framework, and data processing by Liaison Marketing based in Senegal. The survey fieldwork was conducted face-to-face between November 19th and November 29th, 2018, using a multistage stratified random sampling design. The target population for this survey was Nigeriens, 18 years of age or older, living in the three largest cities of Maradi, Niamey, and Zinder. The achieved sample size was 1,011 interviews distributed proportionally across Maradi, Niamey, and Zinder. The sample was proportionally stratified by region, urbanization, age, gender, and socioeconomic status.

In the study area, four districts of Nampula province, farmers are generally far from towns where agricultural input providers are based and formal banking services are not available. Lacking these services, smallholders typically face liquidity constraints during the planting season when returns to input usage are the highest. In order to explore potential policy solutions to this challenge, the project combined training and incentives to use mobile money technology alongside targeted input marketing visits to promote formal saving strategies and increase take-up of basic inputs, primarily seeds, and fertilizer. The goal of the pilot project was to determine whether combining group-level trainings in mobile money technology with targeted direct marketing could increase input usage, and consequently boost agricultural productivity. In collaboration with Vodacom, IFPRI organized a series of trainings, first at the individual level with farm group leaders carried out in Nampula city in June 2014. This was followed by group trainings at local sites to which all farm group members were invited in July-August 2014.

Our floating gardens were designed to be installed in a fishponds/household ponds. The objective of this technology was to support farmers who did not have suitable land to produce vegetables. During site selection, we interviewed a number of beneficiaries and chose 36 households among them based on their enthusiasm, feasibility of the pond to accommodate the floating garden and over all their commitments to collect and provide us with floating garden related data. Each beneficiary was responsible for collecting his/her own dataset. We had designated 1 beneficiaries for each 12 floating gardens who would gathered the data weekly from the other beneficiaries and provided the team with the data once a month. Additionally, our team used to visit the sites when necessary. 

The following data were collected:
I.	Name of crops 
II.	Sowing time
III.	Seed price 
IV.	Germination time
V.	Harvesting time
VI.	Amount of harvest 
VII.	Market price of the harvest 
VIII.	Frequency of manure / pesticide (non-chemical) application
IX.	Price and amount of  manure/chemical 
X.	Maintenance cost   

2. Solar chimney dryer: 
Solar chimney dryer sites were selected by visiting the potential sites followed by subsequent interviews with the beneficiaries. The general selection criteria were; an open space that receives the maximum sunlight time, willingness of host household to share the dryer with other households (12 household used to share one chimney dryer), enthusiasm of the group towards the new technology and necessity of such technology, beneficiaries' agricultural practices and their commitment to collect and share the technology related data with us. Each beneficiary was responsible for collecting his own data set. One designated person for each chimney dryer who would gather the data and had provided them to the team monthly. The following data were collected: 

I.	Name of drying item
II.	Fresh weight and price of the drying item
III.	Dry weight and price of dried item 
IV.	Drying time 
V.	Temperature during drying 
VI.	RH (%) during drying 
VII.	Maintenance cost  
VIII.	Frequency of using the technology 

3. CoolBot regulated cool room:  
Cold room sites were selected by visiting the potential sites followed by subsequent interviews with the beneficiaries. Each site was chosen based on the necessity of the technology, agricultural practices of the beneficiaries, access to nearby market, access to maximum beneficiaries, access to electricity, host beneficiary's willingness to provide land (free of cost) for building the technology and willingness to share it with other beneficiaries (one cold room for 12 beneficiaries), commitment to take care the cool room, collect data and share with us. Each beneficiary was responsible for collecting his/her own dataset. One designated person for each cold room was gathering the data and provided the to the team monthly. 
The following data were collected: 

I.	Name of stored crop
II.	Market price before storing 
III.	Market price after storing 
IV.	Storage duration (entry and exit date) 
V.	Storage temp 
VI.	Storage RH (%)
VII.	Spoilage amount
VIII.	Power usage (electricity and fuel) 
IX.	Maintenance cost

Survey question topics at baseline covered demographics, reasons for method choice, method counseling, past use of contraception, and reasons women thought they might discontinue in the future. At each follow-up, women were asked about whether they were still using the same method and side effects or problems they experienced. Qualitative interview questions obtained more detailed information about side effects experienced, thier impact on the woman's life, and reasons behind continuation, swtiching methods, or discontinuation.

The main purpose of the Title II program is to improve long-term food security of chronically food insecure populations in the target regions.  FFP contracted a firm, ICF International, to conduct a baseline study in targeted areas of the country prior to the start of the new program.  The purpose of the study was to assess the current status of key indicators, have a better understanding of prevailing conditions and perceptions of the population in the implementation areas, and serve as a point of comparison for future final evaluations.  The results were also used to further refine program targeting and, where possible, to improve the understanding of the relationship between variables to inform program design.  The study was conducted in 2013, while FFP expects to conduct final evaluations as close as possible to the end of the program five years later.

Seed size varies widely among different cowpea accessions, and the genetic basis of such variation is not yet well understood. To better decipher the genetic basis of seed size, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and meta-analysis were conducted on a panel of 368 cowpea diverse accessions from 51 countries. Four traits, including seed weight, length, width and density were evaluated across three locations. Using 51,128 single nucleotide polymorphisms covering the cowpea genome, 17 loci were identified for these traits. One locus was common to weight, width and length, suggesting pleiotropy. By integrating synteny-based analysis with common bean, six candidate genes (Vigun05g036000, Vigun05g039600, Vigun05g204200, Vigun08g217000, Vigun11g187000, and Vigun11g191300) which are implicated in multiple functional categories related to seed size such as endosperm development, embryo development, and cell elongation were identified.

 Improve agricultural production and markets and create new opportunities for security and prosperity
 Strengthen the resilience of communities to shocks that can lead to famine and political unrest
 Reduce hunger and improve nutrition, especially among mothers and children

This report details the findings, conclusions and recommendations of a mixed-methods quasi-experimental final impact evaluation (FIE) of the United States Agency for International Development’s (USAID) $50 million, seven-year Feed the Future Nutrition-Led Agriculture Project for Food Security in Senegal, known as “Yaajeende.” The National Cooperative Business Association’s Cooperative League of the USA (NCBA CLUSA) implemented the project. To combat poverty and child malnutrition, Yaajeende sought to accelerate the participation of the very poor in rural economic growth and improve the four dimensions of food security: availability, access, utilization and stability. Yaajeende worked in 790 villages across 49 municipalities (“communes” in French) and nine departments in the Matam, Tambacounda, Kédougou and Kolda regions. The project’s implementation period was November 1, 2010, to September 30, 2017.

The FIE aims to provide USAID with an evidence base on the impacts of the nutrition-led agriculture (NLA) approach that the project utilized on its key objectives, including reduced poverty and malnutrition. The findings are expected to provide accountability and learning value to USAID, including both the Senegal Mission and USAID/Feed the Future. Additional stakeholders include the Government of Senegal, implementing partners and other agencies, donors and practitioners active in nutrition, health, agriculture and integrated sectors.",Feed the Future Senegal: Yaajeende Well-being Data,['184:029__184:019__184:018'],,['Economic Growth'],vcard:Contact,Lena Knezevic,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,"['https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/hux8-4ppy/files/206b7b05-a561-4e69-b4c5-2aaf4edef851', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/hux8-4ppy/files/679ad07a-24ba-435f-b5cb-9827dfb0c58e', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/hux8-4ppy/files/d8d1f5d1-e4c6-4095-8ed1-43f71031ba61']",https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/hux8-4ppy/files/206b7b05-a561-4e69-b4c5-2aaf4edef851,,,,239,,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/5whc-mu7t/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/5whc-mu7t/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/5whc-mu7t/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/5whc-mu7t/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD,,,,,,

CMDRR was split into two awards named as Resilience through Enhanced Adaptation, Action learning Partnership (REAAP) and Restoring Vibrant Villages and Environments (REVIVE).
A population-based household survey was conducted to measure the performance of CMDRR on key indicators. Both REAAP and REVIVE conducted baseline studies in April and May 2015, respectively.

The endline survey targeted, to the extent possible, the same kebeles where the baselines were conducted, and used the same sample sizes to make the methods at endline as comparable to the baseline as possible. Seven kebeles from the REAAP Activity surveyed during baseline did not receive CMDRR interventions, and so were not included in the endline evaluation. Instead, seven comparable kebeles with similar livelihoods and that received the CMDRR interventions were included in the sample. Within kebeles, villages were selected from the administrative lists.

Wiping did not increase disinfection efficacy, and is not recommended as it generates infectious waste. Covering spills decreased disinfection efficacy against E. coli on heavy ­duty tarp but does prevent splashing, which is critical in Ebola contexts.

The program is a randomized controlled trial intervention that included formal (public or government) schools and low-cost private schools (LCPS) located in Nairobi, Kiambu, Nakuru and Kisumu counties. PRIMR and its Kenyan partners created, published, and distributed new teaching and learning materials, based on the existing Kenyan curriculum; designed and led professional development to build the skills of educators and improve student literacy outcomes; and introduced a number of innovative teaching methods. Teachers and head teachers received training to encourage active learning and participation by both girls and boys in the classroom and were further supported with frequent visits and advising by trained instructional coaches.
By mutual agreement among the MoEST, USAID, and RTI, approximately 500 formal schools and LCPSs located in Nairobi, Kiambu, Nakuru, and Kisumu counties were to participate in the PRIMR Initiative. To choose the sample of formal schools, the project team first selected all eligible zones from within the selected locations, then randomly assigned a subset of zones to groups that would receive the PRIMR treatment in phases (Cohorts 1, 2, and 3). Across all three cohorts, 262 formal schools were selected. Sampling for LCPSs began by clustering the schools into geographic groups of either 10 or 15 schools from across Nairobi’s divisions. Twenty clusters then were randomly assigned to Cohorts 1, 2, or 3, stratified by geographic region. The number of LCPSs selected was 240.
In January 2012, the Cohort 1 schools (125 schools: 66 public, 59 LCPS) began implementing the reading interventions using PRIMR-designed materials and techniques, and the math intervention followed beginning in July 2012. The Cohort 2 schools (185: 65 public, 120 LCPS) began reading and math interventions in January 2013. Cohort 3 schools (101: 51 public, 50 LCPS) served as a control group for most of the program, and then began receiving the full intervention during the final stages of PRIMR (January 2014). In addition, it was decided that the 2014 phase of the intervention would be extended to all 547 remaining schools, rather than only to Cohort 3 as originally planned. As a result, the number of pupils benefitting increased from 12,755 in January 2012 to 56,036 in January 2014.
Randomly selected students from all treatment and control schools were assessed via administration of a combined Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA), Early Grade Mathematics Assessment (EGMA), and Snapshot of School Management Effectiveness (SSME) at three time points: baseline, midterm, and endline. The PRIMR Initiative’s research design included several “experiments within an experiment.” These consisted of a study of three different combinations of information and communication technology (ICT) as teaching and learning aids in selected schools in Kisumu County; a longitudinal study of about 600 students who were assessed at all three time points, with their reading and numeracy competency levels compared and contrasted across the assessments; and MoEST-driven policy research on various education issues at the national level.",Primary Mathematics and Reading Initiative Kenya,['184:020'],http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/legalcode,['Basic Education'],vcard:Contact,Adam Weber,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,"['https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/6sah-c973/files/25c30f25-f1d1-41fd-bd09-5857e63a2011', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/6sah-c973/files/81ac7fc5-f3be-4db4-aaa4-43d3b9e27686', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/6sah-c973/files/6ebf2187-f1ed-4e56-a240-2c3650257ad8', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/6sah-c973/files/00e640be-aaa8-4f8c-8256-9b5652fec207', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/6sah-c973/files/0bf3ae78-c392-497d-b4da-48544409fa93', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/6sah-c973/files/e9f69008-74d5-431e-80cb-92ee79987207', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/6sah-c973/files/fc3fb724-2ffb-4700-b86d-c35a418f5576', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/6sah-c973/files/8b99658b-20dd-4d25-8047-96905a8812bc', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/6sah-c973/files/e026c1d8-6439-41dd-b53b-afa63b157458', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/6sah-c973/files/4fe094ac-57dc-4bae-9467-220146f74286']",,,,,288,https://data.usaid.gov/d/wcxa-eft5,,,,,,,,,,

The overarching goal of LTTP II is to enhance pupils' learning in general, and reading proficiency in particular; establish a functional teacher professional development (PD) system; and strengthen the MOE's capacity to manage such a system. The LTTP II was originally designed to work in nine counties: Grand Gedeh, Grand Kru, Lofa, Maryland, Montserrado, Nimba, River Cess, River Gee, and Sinoe. In 2011 and 2012, because of changes in USAID policies, the number of counties was reduced to five (i.e., Bong, Lofa, Margibi, Montserrado, and Nimba), which USAID identifies as a development corridor, containing a majority of the Liberian population.

The LTTP II intervention drew on the EGRA Plus model to introduce similarly structured reading and math programs in grades 1, 2, and 3 to approximately 1,020 schools in four counties (i.e., Bong, Lofa, Montserrado, and Nimba) in a phased approach. Cohort 1, the first to receive support, had 792 schools. During the middle of the 2011/2012 school year, the reading program was introduced in all three grades in these schools. During the middle of the 2012/2013 school year, the mathematics program was introduced in all three grades. Cohort 2, consisting of approximately 330 schools, began participating in the program's reading and mathematics interventions during the 2013/2014 school year and continued during the 2014/2015 school year. Some changes, although not significant, were made to the intervention approach for supporting the Cohort 2 schools.

Schools in the four LTTP II counties were randomly assigned to the Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 groupings. These schools were then grouped in clusters of 12 schools based on geographic proximity, which would allow the program to deliver the interventions more efficiently

Cohort 1: Schools from the four target counties included in Cohort 1 served as the treatment group for the midterm assessment. These schools stopped receiving LTTP II support after the midterm assessment, but they participated in the endline assessment, as a way to determine whether the gains that were achieved during the treatment were sustained.

Cohort 2: Schools included in Cohort 2 in the same four counties began to receive treatment after the midterm assessmentthus, during the final two years of the program. Cohort 2 schools served as a control to which the Cohort 1 results were compared. The performance of Cohort 2 schools were to be compared to that of Cohort 1. The biggest challenge that the program faced regarding the implementation in Cohort 2 schools was the school closings because of the Ebola crisis. Schools were closed between September 2014 and February 2015. Even after the official reopening date, with the gradual actual opening of schools that required LTTP II to wait until schools were safe to open, it took several months to distribute books to schools and to train teachers which in turn severely affected the implementation of the treatment.

External Cohort: A randomly selected sample of schools outside the four target counties served as another comparator, especially after Cohort 2 began receiving treatment alongside Cohort 1.

Except for a small number of schools associated with the RTTIs, schools outside the four target counties did not participate in the program during the lifetime of LTTP II.

Walp) is a warm-season legume with a genetically diverse gene-pool composed of wild and cultivated forms. Cowpea domestication involved considerable phenotypic changes from the wild progenitor, including reduction of pod shattering, increased organ size, and changes in flowering time. Little is known about the genetic basis underlying these changes. In this study, 215 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between a cultivated and a wild cowpea accession were used to evaluate nine domestication-related traits (pod shattering, peduncle length, flower color, days to flowering, 100-seed weight, pod length, leaf length, leaf width and seed number per pod). A high-density genetic map containing 17,739 single nucleotide polymorphisms was constructed and used to identify 16 quantitative trait loci (QTL) for these nine traits. Based on annotations of the cowpea reference genome, genes within these regions are reported. Four regions with clusters of QTL were identified, including one on chromosome 8 related to increased organ size. This study provides new knowledge of the genomic regions controlling domestication-related traits in cowpea as well as candidate genes underlying those QTL.

The purpose of this evaluation of the Social Enterprise Boost Initiative (SEBI) is to determine whether the SEBI activity achieved its objectives and gain lessons for implementation of ongoing or future programs. The evaluation sought to identify: 1) implementation challenges, corrective actions to project management, and progress towards achieving expected results; 2) the factors that contributed to the success/failure of the different project components; 3) the effect of the activity on men and women; and 4) the extent to which SEBI contributed to the local social enterprise (SE) policy environment. The evaluation will serve to inform the United States Agency for International Development Jamaica Mission’s (USAID/Jamaica) Local Partner Development (LPD) program under the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) as well as the Social Enterprise Jamaica (SEJA), which is in the process of being registered as a non-governmental organization (NGO), with a view to continuing some of the work of SEBI once the project ends in December 2018. The exact nature of SEJA’s activities is unclear, although the Evaluation Team (ET) understands that the focus could primarily be on incubation services for SEs under the LPD program.

SEBI was initiated by the Jamaica National Foundation (JNF) and jointly funded by JNF and USAID. The rationale for USAID’s decision to support SEBI in Jamaica, implemented by (JNF), was based on several important factors at the time, namely: 1) low levels of business competitiveness and productivity; 2) a stagnant economy; 3) a high debt burden; and 4) high levels of crime in the country. The genesis of SEBI was in JNF’s observation that not-for-profit and other organizations operating in the social sector were struggling to deliver their core services mainly due to a reliance on grants and donations. The underlying goal therefore was to introduce the social enterprise model to these organizations so that they could start generating their own income and become less reliant on grants and donations. SEBI began in July 2012 and is due for completion at the end of December 2018, following three extensions agreed in Modifications 2, 3, and 5 in the Cooperative Agreement (CA). 

The ET pursued three separate, yet interlinked, data collection activities that formed the basis of its methodological approach to conducting the SEBI evaluation as follows:
1.	Face-to-face meetings on site with SEBI’s incubator and accelerator beneficiary clients as well as representatives from key stakeholders,  including national and local government, the private sector, international community, civil society, NGOs, and business associations and agencies. In total, the ET met with 29 beneficiaries (20 incubators and 13 accelerators) and 30 stakeholders. Team members used semi-structured questionnaires to record answers for later comparative analysis and cross-reference purposes with findings from the other data collection methods, mentioned below. 
2.	The ET hosted four focus group discussions (FGDs) in the parishes (Trelawny, St. James, Westmoreland and Manchester) and one in Kingston with selected groups of SEBI indirect beneficiaries. In total, 31 participants attended the FGDs, providing views and responses to questions which were noted for later cross-referencing with findings from the direct beneficiary and public awareness surveys. 
3.	Two surveys were carried out by Market Research Services Limited (MRSL), based in Kingston, on behalf of the ET (see Annex 6 – Survey Reports for complete analysis of the findings from both surveys).",Final Performance Evaluation of the USAID/Jamaica Social Enterprise Boost Initiative (SEBI),['184:037'],,['Evaluation'],vcard:Contact,Lena Knezevic,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,['https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/8aex-neih/files/3e4a61bb-1d16-414f-abbf-39dfd1c75bce'],,,,,366,https://data.usaid.gov/d/2euu-4fc4,,,,,,,,,,

Once downloaded, the tables can be combined on the 'hhid' column to provide a deeper level of analysis.

The purpose of collecting these data was to examine the rate of land expansion of medium- and large-scale farms compared to small scale farms, look at policy implications of consequent changes in farm structure and the concentration of food production and marketed output.

The data also aim to capture the pace of acquisition of agricultural land by medium- and large-scale investors through de facto land administration policies and the implication of such dynamics on rural youth land accessibility and out migration in the context of customary tenure systems. 

The data contain information about non-farm employment growth, farm size and efficiency,  land disputes and conflicts in rural Tanzania, their causes, possible resolution mechanisms, and policy implications to land investments in Mvomero, Kilombero, Njombe, Kiteto, Magu, Moshi Rural, Mkuranga and Liwale districts of Tanzania.

The data were collected through the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Food Security Policy (FSP), whose mission is to promote inclusive agrifood system productivity growth, improved nutritional outcomes, and enhanced livelihood resilience through improved policy environments. Taking a broad view of agriculture, including the farm and off-farm parts of the agrifood system, FSP strives to increase countries capacity to generate policy-relevant evidence and analysis. This knowledge, when utilized by stakeholders, will improve policy formulation and implementation throughout the food system.

FSP works globally and in particular in eight African countries and Myanmar in Asia.

The training evaluation dataset contains the pre-training and post-training test responses for livestock producers and veterinarians in the Tigray region of Ethiopia during the spring of 2017. It was used to evaluate the learning that occurred. The evaluation was given prior to and post training on transboundary and zoonotic disease presentation and reporting in an effort to evaluate educational interventions in reporting of nationally notifiable diseases. 

The follow-up interview dataset was collected during the winter/spring of 2018 to learn more about the impacts of disease recognition training to livestock producers and veterinarians one year following the training. Four villages in one woreda (district) in the Tigray region were selected by convenience. Two villages had received the training and two had not. Sampling by convenience, producers and veterinarians were asked questions guided by the attached questionnaire about if they trained others, reported diseases, and what incentives they thought would encourage reporting. Producers were livestock producers. Veterinarians included veterinary technicians and veterinarians (private and public).

Five questions evaluated increases in access and utilization of reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health interventions; gender-transformative strategies; sustainability; the program’s learning agenda vis-à-vis the Nigerian government’s learning needs; and use of program data.
The evaluation team used a retrospective analytic and a cross-sectional design to address the five questions, and mixed methods were used for data collection, including reviews of the national District Health Information System (DHIS) 2, MCSP-MNCH datasets, and 51 program documents.
Apparent improvements were noted in the utilization of six interventions: oxytocin, partograph, Chlorhexidine 4% gel, newborn resuscitation, essential newborn care, and integrated Community Case Management, particularly with referral of danger signs. MCSP-MNCH baseline data was not available nor calculable for magnesium sulphate or Kangaroo Mother Care. Data was also not available for postpartum family planning for first-time parents and Bubble Continuous Positive Airway Pressure for newborn resuscitation, as a study was undergoing analysis and data was not ready. Furthermore, the dataset MCSP-MNCH provided to the evaluation team was incomplete, imprecise, and contained errors, raising concerns about noted improvements.
The program’s work in male engagement and Mothers Savings and Loans Clubs hold promise for transforming gender norms but reached too few people. Most of the program’s reproductive health and MNCH interventions are likely to be included in budgets in Ebonyi and Kogi through the World Bank’s Saving One Million Lives project, but without specific commitment from the states’ governors, funding release may be jeopardized. The learning agenda helped inform implementation, but the government did not help shape the research. Last, MCSP-MNCH project created a new DHIS database instance for its project data only, including new indicators that it introduced (like application of Chlorhexidine 4% gel for newborn cord care), as well as indicators that were already available in the national DHIS 2 database; it is housed within the same server as the national DHIS 2.",Facility Assessment,['184:017__184:016__184:037'],,['Maternal and Child Health'],vcard:Contact,Janet Fennema,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,"['https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/xy3c-3gvd/files/1dd7d3a3-e5de-4ae7-be21-21c8d9226baa', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/xy3c-3gvd/files/e458fe11-0d5c-4843-86f4-bd8a0477a8aa', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/xy3c-3gvd/files/7ee9ce09-9ea9-4bba-8c73-cb09a15e3e08']",https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/xy3c-3gvd/files/2657bb5b-7357-429e-b8ae-b5123edf82fa,,,,423,,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/9bie-z8ei/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/9bie-z8ei/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/9bie-z8ei/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/9bie-z8ei/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD,,,,,,

Wiping did not increase disinfection efficacy, and is not recommended as it generates infectious waste. Covering spills decreased disinfection efficacy against E. coli on heavy ­duty tarp but does prevent splashing, which is critical in Ebola contexts.

To combat poverty and child malnutrition, Yaajeende sought to accelerate the participation of the very poor in rural economic growth and improve the four dimensions of food security: availability, access, utilization and stability. Yaajeende worked in 790 villages across 49 municipalities (“communes” in French) and nine departments in the Matam, Tambacounda, Kédougou and Kolda regions. The project’s implementation period was November 1, 2010, to September 30, 2017.

The FIE aims to provide USAID with an evidence base on the impacts of the nutrition-led agriculture (NLA) approach that the project utilized on its key objectives, including reduced poverty and malnutrition. The findings are expected to provide accountability and learning value to USAID, including both the Senegal Mission and USAID/Feed the Future.

The purpose of this evaluation of the Social Enterprise Boost Initiative (SEBI) is to determine whether the SEBI activity achieved its objectives and gain lessons for implementation of ongoing or future programs. The evaluation sought to identify: 1) implementation challenges, corrective actions to project management, and progress towards achieving expected results; 2) the factors that contributed to the success/failure of the different project components; 3) the effect of the activity on men and women; and 4) the extent to which SEBI contributed to the local social enterprise (SE) policy environment. The evaluation will serve to inform the United States Agency for International Development Jamaica Mission’s (USAID/Jamaica) Local Partner Development (LPD) program under the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) as well as the Social Enterprise Jamaica (SEJA), which is in the process of being registered as a non-governmental organization (NGO), with a view to continuing some of the work of SEBI once the project ends in December 2018. The exact nature of SEJA’s activities is unclear, although the Evaluation Team (ET) understands that the focus could primarily be on incubation services for SEs under the LPD program.

SEBI was initiated by the Jamaica National Foundation (JNF) and jointly funded by JNF and USAID. The rationale for USAID’s decision to support SEBI in Jamaica, implemented by (JNF), was based on several important factors at the time, namely: 1) low levels of business competitiveness and productivity; 2) a stagnant economy; 3) a high debt burden; and 4) high levels of crime in the country. The genesis of SEBI was in JNF’s observation that not-for-profit and other organizations operating in the social sector were struggling to deliver their core services mainly due to a reliance on grants and donations. The underlying goal therefore was to introduce the social enterprise model to these organizations so that they could start generating their own income and become less reliant on grants and donations. SEBI began in July 2012 and is due for completion at the end of December 2018, following three extensions agreed in Modifications 2, 3, and 5 in the Cooperative Agreement (CA). 

The ET pursued three separate, yet interlinked, data collection activities that formed the basis of its methodological approach to conducting the SEBI evaluation as follows:
1.	Face-to-face meetings on site with SEBI’s incubator and accelerator beneficiary clients as well as representatives from key stakeholders,  including national and local government, the private sector, international community, civil society, NGOs, and business associations and agencies. In total, the ET met with 29 beneficiaries (20 incubators and 13 accelerators) and 30 stakeholders. Team members used semi-structured questionnaires to record answers for later comparative analysis and cross-reference purposes with findings from the other data collection methods, mentioned below. 
2.	The ET hosted four focus group discussions (FGDs) in the parishes (Trelawny, St. James, Westmoreland and Manchester) and one in Kingston with selected groups of SEBI indirect beneficiaries. In total, 31 participants attended the FGDs, providing views and responses to questions which were noted for later cross-referencing with findings from the direct beneficiary and public awareness surveys. 
3.	Two surveys were carried out by Market Research Services Limited (MRSL), based in Kingston, on behalf of the ET (see Annex 6 – Survey Reports for complete analysis of the findings from both surveys).","Final Performance Evaluation of the USAID/Jamaica Social Enterprise Boost Initiative (SEBI), Beneficiary Survey Data",['184:037'],,['Evaluation'],vcard:Contact,Christopher Coffman,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,"['https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/9njk-wzk7/files/cc499ccb-3af9-43e2-a8d2-6eddbbb6c698', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/9njk-wzk7/files/ad9c52d2-ce5b-4694-b0a3-bdaf19dce730']",https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/9njk-wzk7/files/3a3dad5e-58a9-4e04-a30a-f4f88785071e,,,,450,,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/9njk-wzk7/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/9njk-wzk7/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/9njk-wzk7/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/9njk-wzk7/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD,,,,,,

The main USAID/SA program is the School Capacity and Innovation Program (SCIP), which also leverages significant private sector resources, amplifying the impact of USAID’s investment in the South African education system. SCIP is co-funded by The ELMA Foundation and J.P. Morgan and designed in collaboration with the South African Department of Basic Education. SCIP supports local South African models or interventions that work directly with teachers and school management teams in innovative ways in order to improve their practice as instructional leaders and managers. SCIP is aligned to the USAID Global Education Strategy (2011–2015) which supports interventions to improve learning outcomes with a focus on primary grade reading as a measure of performance. In addition to seeking initiatives that demonstrate innovation and impact, sustainability and scalability are key components of the SCIP program.

The Teacher Assessment Resources for Monitoring and Improving Instruction for Foundation Phase (TARMII-FP) will provide teachers with a computer-based assessment tool that will help teachers to more effectively address individual student learning needs in literacy. TARMII-FP is implemented by the Human Sciences Research Council and is co-funded by USAID, the ELMA Foundation, and J.P. Morgan Chase Foundation, with non-financial support from the South African Department of Basic Education. This $1.5 million project, part of the SCIP, is designed to improve primary grade reading outcomes by building teacher effectiveness and strengthening classroom and school management. Running from July 2012 to June 2015, TARMII-FP will enable teachers to draw upon a database of thousands of reading activities and test items to generate assessments and homework exercises tailored for their students.

Five questions evaluated increases in access and utilization of reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health interventions; gender-transformative strategies; sustainability; the program’s learning agenda vis-à-vis the Nigerian government’s learning needs; and use of program data.
The evaluation team used a retrospective analytic and a cross-sectional design to address the five questions, and mixed methods were used for data collection, including reviews of the national District Health Information System (DHIS) 2, MCSP-MNCH datasets, and 51 program documents.
Apparent improvements were noted in the utilization of six interventions: oxytocin, partograph, Chlorhexidine 4% gel, newborn resuscitation, essential newborn care, and integrated Community Case Management, particularly with referral of danger signs. MCSP-MNCH baseline data was not available nor calculable for magnesium sulphate or Kangaroo Mother Care. Data was also not available for postpartum family planning for first-time parents and Bubble Continuous Positive Airway Pressure for newborn resuscitation, as a study was undergoing analysis and data was not ready. Furthermore, the dataset MCSP-MNCH provided to the evaluation team was incomplete, imprecise, and contained errors, raising concerns about noted improvements.
The program’s work in male engagement and Mothers Savings and Loans Clubs hold promise for transforming gender norms but reached too few people. Most of the program’s reproductive health and MNCH interventions are likely to be included in budgets in Ebonyi and Kogi through the World Bank’s Saving One Million Lives project, but without specific commitment from the states’ governors, funding release may be jeopardized. The learning agenda helped inform implementation, but the government did not help shape the research. Last, MCSP-MNCH project created a new DHIS database instance for its project data only, including new indicators that it introduced (like application of Chlorhexidine 4% gel for newborn cord care), as well as indicators that were already available in the national DHIS 2 database; it is housed within the same server as the national DHIS 2.",MNCH Workers Knowledge Test,['184:017__184:016__184:037'],,['Maternal and Child Health'],vcard:Contact,Janet Fennema,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,"['https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/xy3c-3gvd/files/1dd7d3a3-e5de-4ae7-be21-21c8d9226baa', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/xy3c-3gvd/files/e458fe11-0d5c-4843-86f4-bd8a0477a8aa', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/xy3c-3gvd/files/7ee9ce09-9ea9-4bba-8c73-cb09a15e3e08']",https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/xy3c-3gvd/files/2657bb5b-7357-429e-b8ae-b5123edf82fa,,,,524,,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/an5y-7rrr/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/an5y-7rrr/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/an5y-7rrr/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/an5y-7rrr/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD,,,,,,

CTWWC implements within a context of growing global interest in family care and care reform and as a result of an increased understanding that residential care of children is a significant problem that will be best addressed through collaboration between national, regional, and global stakeholders to develop care systems that strengthen families, prevent family separation, and promote family-based alternative care options.

In 2021, a household survey was implemented as part of CTWWC’s Year 3 Review. It was designed to address the following research questions:
1. What aspects of family strengthening support do caregivers think have affected (negatively and positively) their ability to care and provide for their children?
2. What proportion of children and caregivers report selected protective factors in their life?

A list of 50 villages were provided by Farm Input Promotions-Africa (FIPS), an agricultural service provider, including 41 where FIPS was active and 9 where they were not. The 9 villages unsupported by FIPS were all included, and 18 of the supported villages were randomly chosen to be in the study. These 27 villages were randomly assigned to one of three groups: control, video only, and video plus audio reminders. Thirty maize farmers in the non-FIPS villages (which had a larger population, and 17 farmers in the FIPS villages) were randomly chosen and were surveyed before and after an intervention to see if knowledge of and adoption of DT maize varieties were impacted. The primary intervention was a participatory video screened in a set of villages that educated farmers about DT maize varieties including appropriate planting and growing techniques. A narrative/story-telling film shot in the region was used featuring local farmer-actors speaking in the local dialect (Kamba). Following the screening, a moderated discussion was held to reinforce information from the video. In the video plus audio group, a series of four follow-up audio reminders were sent to farmers' mobile phones at key points in the season. Farmers in the control group of villages received no video or audio interventions.

The Building Stock Sample contains some 1,400 large buildings of all categories and representative of 3 typical climate zones:
• Northern zone (Hanoi & Hai Phong cities): 490 buildings
• Central zone (Danang city): 316 buildings
• Southern zone (Ho Chi Minh and Can Tho cities): 623 buildings

The stock data contains basic information for each building, including building type, year built, total floor area; many buildings contain extra information such as number of stories, number of lifts, type and size of electric generator, etc. For the detailed building energy performance survey, the Program’s approach is to randomly select 280 buildings (20%) from Departments of Construction sample stocks of buildings for a detailed survey.

To help achieve this purpose, the LGA works in close partnership with relevant institutions in the GoE, Ethiopian academic and research institutions, civil society, the private sector, and other development partners operating in the land sector to implement activities under two components. Component 1 strengthens the national land governance system, while Component 2 expands communal land tenure security in pastoral areas.

From early 2010 through spring of 2012, the project was implemented in 250 schools throughout all six Ministry of Education (MOE) regions. Among the schools originally targeted for project intervention were 54 schools in crime-prone communities, which received additional resources through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI), including books and computers. In contrast to previous USAID-funded projects since 1998, the current project did not have a direct presence in the schools themselves. Rather, a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the project and the MOE, as well as terms of reference (TOR) between the project and the Jamaica Teaching Council (JTC), devolved much of the responsibility for teacher training to the JTC, and the responsibility for the monitoring of school-based project implementation to the MOE. 

Underlying this model—and in line with the current USAID Forward objective of building the capacity of countries to lead their own development—was the logic that the MOE and its associated agencies would be in a position to assume progressively more responsibility for project implementation. In accordance with the project design, project staff collaborated with JTC to train a small group of trainers, made up of retired teachers and other educational specialists. These trainers then trained principals and “resource teachers” in workshops facilitated by regional education officers. Resource teachers then returned to their home schools and trained their colleagues (referred to in this evaluation as “non-resource teachers”), so that all the teachers in the 250 project schools could implement the project-promoted teaching techniques in their classrooms. This model of training, known as the “cascade model,” is intended to build the capacity of the education system at all levels, while also reaching a large number of teachers with a relatively small number of direct, project-run trainings.",Jamaica Basic Education Project,['184:020'],http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/legalcode,['Basic Education'],vcard:Contact,USAID Data Services,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,"['https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/bn76-kgmm/files/56fabe11-70bc-4762-aca0-422bd110faa4', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/bn76-kgmm/files/a0861034-05cf-4444-b364-c782984dc9c2', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/bn76-kgmm/files/09b72103-3caf-4c96-b06f-e97680aee837']",,,,,577,https://data.usaid.gov/d/vtsu-vupx,,,,,,,,,,

This report details the findings, conclusions and recommendations of a mixed-methods quasi-experimental final impact evaluation (FIE) of the United States Agency for International Development’s (USAID) $50 million, seven-year Feed the Future Nutrition-Led Agriculture Project for Food Security in Senegal, known as “Yaajeende.” The National Cooperative Business Association’s Cooperative League of the USA (NCBA CLUSA) implemented the project. To combat poverty and child malnutrition, Yaajeende sought to accelerate the participation of the very poor in rural economic growth and improve the four dimensions of food security: availability, access, utilization and stability. Yaajeende worked in 790 villages across 49 municipalities (“communes” in French) and nine departments in the Matam, Tambacounda, Kédougou and Kolda regions. The project’s implementation period was November 1, 2010, to September 30, 2017.

The FIE aims to provide USAID with an evidence base on the impacts of the nutrition-led agriculture (NLA) approach that the project utilized on its key objectives, including reduced poverty and malnutrition. The findings are expected to provide accountability and learning value to USAID, including both the Senegal Mission and USAID/Feed the Future.

In the study area, four districts of Nampula province, farmers are generally far from towns where agricultural input providers are based and formal banking services are not available. Lacking these services, smallholders typically face liquidity constraints during the planting season when returns to input usage are the highest. In order to explore potential policy solutions to this challenge, the project combined training and incentives to use mobile money technology alongside targeted input marketing visits to promote formal saving strategies and increase take-up of basic inputs, primarily seeds, and fertilizer. The goal of the pilot project was to determine whether combining group-level trainings in mobile money technology with targeted direct marketing could increase input usage, and consequently boost agricultural productivity. In collaboration with Vodacom, IFPRI organized a series of trainings, first at the individual level with farm group leaders carried out in Nampula city in June 2014.

This report details the findings, conclusions and recommendations of a mixed-methods quasi-experimental final impact evaluation (FIE) of the United States Agency for International Development’s (USAID) $50 million, seven-year Feed the Future Nutrition-Led Agriculture Project for Food Security in Senegal, known as “Yaajeende.” The National Cooperative Business Association’s Cooperative League of the USA (NCBA CLUSA) implemented the project. To combat poverty and child malnutrition, Yaajeende sought to accelerate the participation of the very poor in rural economic growth and improve the four dimensions of food security: availability, access, utilization and stability. Yaajeende worked in 790 villages across 49 municipalities (“communes” in French) and nine departments in the Matam, Tambacounda, Kédougou and Kolda regions. The project’s implementation period was November 1, 2010, to September 30, 2017.

The FIE aims to provide USAID with an evidence base on the impacts of the nutrition-led agriculture (NLA) approach that the project utilized on its key objectives, including reduced poverty and malnutrition. The findings are expected to provide accountability and learning value to USAID, including both the Senegal Mission and USAID/Feed the Future.

The overarching goal of LTTP II is to enhance pupils' learning in general, and reading proficiency in particular; establish a functional teacher professional development (PD) system; and strengthen the MOE's capacity to manage such a system. The LTTP II was originally designed to work in nine counties: Grand Gedeh, Grand Kru, Lofa, Maryland, Montserrado, Nimba, River Cess, River Gee, and Sinoe. In 2011 and 2012, because of changes in USAID policies, the number of counties was reduced to five (i.e., Bong, Lofa, Margibi, Montserrado, and Nimba), which USAID identifies as a development corridor, containing a majority of the Liberian population.

The LTTP II intervention drew on the EGRA Plus model to introduce similarly structured reading and math programs in grades 1, 2, and 3 to approximately 1,020 schools in four counties (i.e., Bong, Lofa, Montserrado, and Nimba) in a phased approach. Cohort 1, the first to receive support, had 792 schools. During the middle of the 2011/2012 school year, the reading program was introduced in all three grades in these schools. During the middle of the 2012/2013 school year, the mathematics program was introduced in all three grades. Cohort 2, consisting of approximately 330 schools, began participating in the program's reading and mathematics interventions during the 2013/2014 school year and continued during the 2014/2015 school year. Some changes, although not significant, were made to the intervention approach for supporting the Cohort 2 schools.

Schools in the four LTTP II counties were randomly assigned to the Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 groupings. These schools were then grouped in clusters of 12 schools based on geographic proximity, which would allow the program to deliver the interventions more efficiently

Cohort 1: Schools from the four target counties included in Cohort 1 served as the treatment group for the midterm assessment. These schools stopped receiving LTTP II support after the midterm assessment, but they participated in the endline assessment, as a way to determine whether the gains that were achieved during the treatment were sustained.

Cohort 2: Schools included in Cohort 2 in the same four counties began to receive treatment after the midterm assessment, thus, during the final two years of the program. Cohort 2 schools served as a control to which the Cohort 1 results were compared. The performance of Cohort 2 schools were to be compared to that of Cohort 1. The biggest challenge that the program faced regarding the implementation in Cohort 2 schools was the school closings because of the Ebola crisis. Schools were closed between September 2014 and February 2015. Even after the official reopening date, with the gradual actual opening of schools that required LTTP II to wait until schools were safe to open, it took several months to distribute books to schools and to train teachers which in turn severely affected the implementation of the treatment.

External Cohort: A randomly selected sample of schools outside the four target counties served as another comparator, especially after Cohort 2 began receiving treatment alongside Cohort 1.

Except for a small number of schools associated with the RTTIs, schools outside the four target counties did not participate in the program during the lifetime of LTTP II.",Liberia Teacher Training Program II,['184:020'],http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/legalcode,['Basic Education'],vcard:Contact,Lena Knezevic,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,"['https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/d2fs-hkac/files/675aa430-fbe1-4c23-ba1d-e4bcc971d060', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/d2fs-hkac/files/60f0fde9-e937-42d4-94ae-8963cf70d623', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/d2fs-hkac/files/efb38a10-495f-4f3e-8d48-89647e90a69d', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/d2fs-hkac/files/fa7c964f-918c-4ddc-a2dd-10add967a556', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/d2fs-hkac/files/5bf5e421-b66f-474a-85d2-f8ad56321718', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/d2fs-hkac/files/e9451b11-9888-4261-9d5f-5dc3bc5959fa', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/d2fs-hkac/files/b8df35c5-9bb0-457b-8c0b-79af3e1988a4', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/d2fs-hkac/files/9e51a73c-9e05-4587-9165-58a6d217ca16']",,,,,673,https://data.usaid.gov/d/738f-74uz,,,,,,,,,,

An assembly of the single-haplotype inbred genome of cowpea IT97K-499-35 was developed by exploiting the synergies between single-molecule real-time sequencing, optical and genetic mapping, and an assembly reconciliation algorithm. A total of 519 Mb is included in the assembled sequences. Nearly half of the assembled sequence is composed of repetitive elements, which are enriched within recombination-poor pericentromeric regions. A comparative analysis of these elements suggests that genome size differences between Vigna species are mainly attributable to changes in the amount of Gypsy retrotransposons. Conversely, genes are more abundant in more distal, high-recombination regions of the chromosomes; there appears to be more duplication of genes within the NBS-LRR and the SAUR-like auxin superfamilies compared with other warm-season legumes that have been sequenced. 

A surprising outcome is the identification of an inversion of 4.2 Mb among landraces and cultivars, which includes a gene that has been associated in other plants with interactions with the parasitic weed Striga gesnerioides. The genome sequence facilitated the identification of a putative syntelog for multiple organ gigantism in legumes. A revised numbering system has been adopted for cowpea chromosomes based on synteny with common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris).

This dataset contains data from Modules F and J of the questionnaire and has 295 columns and 4,766 rows.  In fiscal year 2012, USAID's Office of Food for Peace (FFP) awarded funding to private voluntary organizations (PVOs) to design and implement a multi-year Title II development food assistance program in Uganda.  The main purpose of the Title II program is to improve long-term food security of chronically food insecure population in the target regions.  FFP contracted a firm, ICF International to conduct a baseline study in targeted areas of the country prior to the start of the new program.  The purpose of the study was to assess the current status of key indicators, have a better understanding of prevailing conditions and perceptions of the population in the implementation areas, and serve as a point of comparison for future final evaluations.  Results would also be used to further refine program targeting and, where possible, to understand the relationship between variables to inform program design.  The study was conducted in 2013, while FFP expects to conduct final evaluations as close as possible to the end of the program five years later.  The data asset is comprised of six datasets: 1) a description of all members of the households surveyed, 2) data on maternal health and sanitation practices, 3) data about the children in the household, 4) data describing the agricultural practices of the household, 5) data describing the food consumption of the household (broken into 4 smaller spreadsheets), and 6) and a description of the weights that should be applied during the analysis of the other datasets.","Baseline Study of Food for Peace Title II Development Food Assistance Program in Karamoja, Uganda--Maternal Health and Household Sanitation","['184:016,184:018,184:019,184:029,184:037']",http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/legalcode,['Humanitarian Assistance'],vcard:Contact,USAID Data Services,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,,,,,,692,,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/d7ka-5mp2/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/d7ka-5mp2/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/d7ka-5mp2/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/d7ka-5mp2/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD,,,,,,

The Tusome Early Grade Reading Program involves a national effort in Kenya to scale up a proven model for improved results in early grade literacy. Based on positive findings during a rigorous impact evaluation of a pilot test of this intervention, the Government of Kenya (GOK) asked USAID/Kenya to assist with the nationwide rollout of an activity to improve reading skills and increase the capacity of educators and the GOK to deliver and administer early grade reading (EGR) programs modeled on the pilot activity’s success. Tusome, which means “Let’s Read” in Kiswahili, targeted 28,000 formal and nonformal public and low-cost private primary schools in the 47 counties in Kenya (nationwide). About 1,000 of these are informal schools that exist mostly in urban “slums,” while the vast majority of the remaining 27,000 schools are in rural areas. Roughly 5.4 million children who entered primary school between 2014 and 2017 are expected to benefit from this scaling-up initiative. Intermediate beneficiaries include: 1) approximately 60,000 class 1 and 2 teachers, 2) 28,000 primary school head teachers, 3) 1,052 Teacher Advisory Center (TAC) tutors, plus “coaches” for nonformal schools and 4) 300 senior education personnel.

Seed size varies widely among different cowpea accessions, and the genetic basis of such variation is not yet well understood. To better decipher the genetic basis of seed size, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and meta-analysis were conducted on a panel of 368 cowpea diverse accessions from 51 countries. Four traits, including seed weight, length, width and density were evaluated across three locations. Using 51,128 single nucleotide polymorphisms covering the cowpea genome, 17 loci were identified for these traits. One locus was common to weight, width and length, suggesting pleiotropy. By integrating synteny-based analysis with common bean, six candidate genes (Vigun05g036000, Vigun05g039600, Vigun05g204200, Vigun08g217000, Vigun11g187000, and Vigun11g191300) which are implicated in multiple functional categories related to seed size such as endosperm development, embryo development, and cell elongation were identified. These results suggest that a combination of GWAS meta-analysis with synteny comparison in a related plant is an efficient approach to identify candidate gene (s) for complex traits in cowpea.

The project sold over 63,000 toilets between 2014 and 2018 using sales agents who were both men and women. In 2018 - 2019, iDE was a grantee under the WASHPaLS contract to study whether the gender of the sales agent had any association with different sanitation behaviors and outcomes. This data is a one-time cross-section dataset of clients who purchased from an iDE supported sales agent and was collected in 2018. Though a consent script was read to all participants at the start of the survey, ethical review was not obtained for this cross-sectional study as no personally identifiable information was collected from participants at any time, and the survey questions posed only minimal risk.

The sampling frame for the survey data collection was all households that purchased a latrine from iDE-trained sales agents within the four research districts for which we have recorded gender of sales agent. Within our four districts of operation, there were 249 village development committees (VDC) with sales records. The sample was drawn using a multi-stage random sample with stratification based on VDC and gender of the sales agent. First, given that the primary stratum of interest is sales agent gender, we ensured that we had a robust sample size of 300 households for each sales agent gender strata to allow for difference-in-means testing with significance. The 300 households per sales agent gender were then distributed equally among the four districts, resulting in 75 households per gender per district.

The study was incorporated with the larger MCSP-supported initiative to improve quality of care for maternal and child health in Nigeria. The study took place in health care facilities in Kogi and Ebonyi state, Nigeria. In each, one primary health care facility, one secondary facility, and one referral hospital were selected. Women who met eligibility requirements (at least 18 years of age, presenting to the facility before stage 2 of labour, and able to provide consent) were recruited for participation. Up to 6 hours of observation were completed during labour. Trained enumerators recorded all hand hygiene actions and procedures completed by health care staff. Data were then analysed in order to develop a time-specific measure of individual hand hygiene, and measures were translated grouped into five categories: proper hygiene protocol (sterile gloves, handwashing with soap and no recontamination), handwashing with soap and no recontamination, glove change only and no recontamination, hands not washed or recontaminated, and hands not washed or recontamination following select high risk events (contact with another patient, contact with stools or body fluids, contact with surfaces or objects contaminated with stools or body fluids).

A list of 50 villages were provided by Farm Input Promotions-Africa (FIPS), an agricultural service provider, including 41 where FIPS was active and 9 where they were not. The 9 villages unsupported by FIPS were all included, and 18 of the supported villages were randomly chosen to be in the study. These 27 villages were randomly assigned to one of three groups: control, video only, and video plus audio reminders. Thirty maize farmers in the non-FIPS villages (which had a larger population, and 17 farmers in the FIPS villages) were randomly chosen and were surveyed before and after an intervention to see if knowledge of and adoption of DT maize varieties were impacted. The primary intervention was a participatory video screened in a set of villages that educated farmers about DT maize varieties including appropriate planting and growing techniques. A narrative/story-telling film shot in the region was used featuring local farmer-actors speaking in the local dialect (Kamba). Following the screening, a moderated discussion was held to reinforce information from the video. In the video plus audio group, a series of four follow-up audio reminders were sent to farmers' mobile phones at key points in the season. Farmers in the control group of villages received no video or audio interventions. The baseline survey was completed in early February 2016, the video screenings took place in late February, and the follow-up survey on the same households was completed in September 2016.

By randomly assigning employees to different varieties of a salary-linked savings account, we find that default enrollment increases participation by 40 percentage points—an effect equivalent to providing a 50% matching incentive. We then use a series of experimental interventions to differentiate between explanations for the default effect, which we conclude is driven largely by present-biased preferences and the cognitive cost of thinking through different savings scenarios. Default assignment also changes employees' attitudes toward saving, and makes them more likely to actively decide to save after the study concludes.

This report details the findings, conclusions and recommendations of a mixed-methods quasi-experimental final impact evaluation (FIE) of the United States Agency for International Development’s (USAID) $50 million, seven-year Feed the Future Nutrition-Led Agriculture Project for Food Security in Senegal, known as “Yaajeende.” The National Cooperative Business Association’s Cooperative League of the USA (NCBA CLUSA) implemented the project. To combat poverty and child malnutrition, Yaajeende sought to accelerate the participation of the very poor in rural economic growth and improve the four dimensions of food security: availability, access, utilization and stability. Yaajeende worked in 790 villages across 49 municipalities (“communes” in French) and nine departments in the Matam, Tambacounda, Kédougou and Kolda regions. The project’s implementation period was November 1, 2010, to September 30, 2017.

The FIE aims to provide USAID with an evidence base on the impacts of the nutrition-led agriculture (NLA) approach that the project utilized on its key objectives, including reduced poverty and malnutrition. The findings are expected to provide accountability and learning value to USAID, including both the Senegal Mission and USAID/Feed the Future.

MYB domain proteins have been shown in other species to control expression of genes encoding enzymes for the final steps in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. PCR analysis indicated that a presence/absence variation of one or more MYB113 genes may control the presence or absence of black pigment.

This study makes use of available resources, including mapping populations, a reference genome, and a high-density single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping platform, to map the black seed coat and purple pod tip color traits, with the gene symbol Bl, in cowpea. Several gene models encoding MYB domain protein 113 were identified as candidate genes. MYB domain proteins have been shown in other species to control expression of genes encoding enzymes for the final steps in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. PCR analysis indicated that a presence/absence variation of one or more MYB113 genes may control the presence or absence of black pigment.

This report details the findings, conclusions and recommendations of a mixed-methods quasi-experimental final impact evaluation (FIE) of the United States Agency for International Development’s (USAID) $50 million, seven-year Feed the Future Nutrition-Led Agriculture Project for Food Security in Senegal, known as “Yaajeende.” The National Cooperative Business Association’s Cooperative League of the USA (NCBA CLUSA) implemented the project. To combat poverty and child malnutrition, Yaajeende sought to accelerate the participation of the very poor in rural economic growth and improve the four dimensions of food security: availability, access, utilization and stability. Yaajeende worked in 790 villages across 49 municipalities (“communes” in French) and nine departments in the Matam, Tambacounda, Kédougou and Kolda regions. The project’s implementation period was November 1, 2010, to September 30, 2017.

MS2 and M13 were only reduced by 3.4 log and 3.5 log after a 10-­minute exposure to 0.5% NaOCl, and would be overly conservative surrogates. Conversely, PR772 was too easily inactivated for surrogate use, as it was reduced by >4.8 log after only 1­-minute exposure to 0.5% NaOCl. Phi6 was slightly more resistant than the Ebola virus, with 4.1 log reduction after a 5­-minute exposure and not detected after a 10-­minute exposure to 0.5% NaOCl. We therefore recommend

Analysis of soil properties and soil classification in the resulting dataset of 468 sites by land use, landscape position, and elevation revealed important relationships relevant for management and land use planning. These sites occurred across a range of landscape positions and an elevation gradient from 1040 – 2240 m.a.s.l. Soil diversity at the U.S. Order and WRB Reference Group levels was higher than expected, with five U.S. soil orders and seven WRB Reference Groups described in the dataset, and the highest soil diversity occurring at lower landscape positions. We found that soil organic carbon (SOC) and pH were two master variables that were correlated most other soil properties. Sites under cultivated land uses had the lowest topsoil soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations, and SOC generally increased with increasing elevation. Mature forest and charcoal production areas did not significantly differ in their depth distributions of SOC. Valley soils had significantly lower surface SOC concentrations but higher exchangeable bases and pH values than all other landscape positions. Soil pH decreased by an average of 3.5 units across the entire elevation gradient and decreased by 1 unit with elevation even after SOC, land use and landscape position were included in multiple regression models. Local pedotransfer functions were developed to assist with the use of pH, clay and SOC as proxies for more difficult to measure soil properties such as cation exchange capacity (CEC) and base saturation (B.S.), bulk density and total phosphorus. Phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) were
identified as the most likely limiting nutrients in West Usambaran plateau soils in general. This information is critical for sustainable land management which will be applicable to the soils of other mountain complexes in the Eastern Arc chain.","Soil Properties and Classification - West Usambara Mountains, Tanzania",['184:029'],https://www.usa.gov/government-works,['Agriculture'],vcard:Contact,Lena Knezevic,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,,,,,,884,https://data.usaid.gov/d/mvxg-vsy2,,,,,,,,,,

CMDRR was split into two awards named as Resilience through Enhanced Adaptation, Action learning Partnership (REAAP) and Restoring Vibrant Villages and Environments (REVIVE).

The endline survey targeted, to the extent possible, the same kebeles where the baselines were
conducted, and used the same sample sizes to make the methods at endline as comparable to the baseline as possible. Seven kebeles from the REAAP Activity surveyed during baseline did not receive CMDRR interventions, and so were not included in the endline evaluation. Instead, seven comparable kebeles with
similar livelihoods and that received the CMDRR interventions were included in the sample. Within kebeles, villages were selected from the administrative lists. In REAAP areas, 39 households were interviewed per kebele. In REVIVE areas, the sample was half of the villages per kebele. Enumerators sampled respondent households in each kebele on location using an on-site systematic random sampling
methodology.

The original EMACK project was initiated in 2006 to increase quality educational opportunities for pre-primary, primary, and lower secondary school children who had been historically marginalized by cultural practices and poverty in Coast Province (CP), North Eastern Province (NEP), and informal settlements of Nairobi. From 2006 to 2012, as a part of the EMACK project, AKF developed and implemented a package of interventions focused on learner engagement and achievement at the classroom level in order to improve learning outcomes and learner transitions from pre-primary to lower secondary school. By 2012, EMACK had reached 767 informal and formal schools in 23 districts across Nairobi, CP, and NEP, benefitting nearly 425,000 people, including 400,000 children (215,426 boys and 183,706 girls), 4,000 teachers, and 11,000 orphans and vulnerable children.

In 2012 EMACK refocused its interventions towards building improved readiness of children (before and as they enter primary school) and ensuring schools, especially the lower primary standards (standards 1 through 3) are ready to support children’s learning and development. This refocus, EMACK II, complements the USAID education strategy (April 2011 – 2015) and has been developed by AKF in collaboration with USAID. The overall goal of the re-aligned EMACK II (Oct 2012-Sept 2014) program is to “enhance equitable access and improve learning outcomes in Kiswahili, English and Mathematics for children in primary grades 1, 2 & 3. To achieve the re-aligned EMACK II goal, AKF identified the following four revised strategic objectives (SOs):

1. Improved teaching and learning in Kiswahili, English and mathematics in primary grades1, 2 and 3 in target areas of CP, NEP and the informal settlements of Nairobi directly benefiting over 269,000 children attending 800 schools (formal and informal).  

2. Improved effectiveness, efficiency and accountability of school management, and improved parents’ and communities’ participation to support reading outcomes in primary grades1, 2 and 3 in CP, NEP and the informal settlements of Nairobi in 800 schools (formal and informal).

3.

Baseline data were collected between November 2015 and January 2016, and endline data collection occurred in January 2017. To collect data, NORC fielded a parent/caregiver survey, a student survey, and an Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) at baseline and endline. In addition, in June 2016 a midline survey on a subsample of treatment caregivers was fielded to document program uptake. To construct the sample frame, Advanced Teams of enumerators were sent to the field to survey all students in 1st and 2nd grades in 80 sampled schools and ask if anyone in their home had a cell phone, which was a requirement to participate in the study. The caregiver survey was developed by NORC and INESOR, and was intended to determine the respondent’s eligibility to participate in the study and to assess the home literacy environment and household assets. The student questionnaire assessed student reading practices at home and in school. The EGRA includes five tasks that measure the following capacities: Orientation to Print, Letter Sound Identification, Non-Word Reading, Oral Reading Passage, Reading Comprehension, and Listening Comprehension.

Five questions evaluated increases in access and utilization of reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health interventions; gender-transformative strategies; sustainability; the program’s learning agenda vis-à-vis the Nigerian government’s learning needs; and use of program data.
The evaluation team used a retrospective analytic and a cross-sectional design to address the five questions, and mixed methods were used for data collection, including reviews of the national District Health Information System (DHIS) 2, MCSP-MNCH datasets, and 51 program documents.
Apparent improvements were noted in the utilization of six interventions: oxytocin, partograph, Chlorhexidine 4% gel, newborn resuscitation, essential newborn care, and integrated Community Case Management, particularly with referral of danger signs. MCSP-MNCH baseline data was not available nor calculable for magnesium sulphate or Kangaroo Mother Care. Data was also not available for postpartum family planning for first-time parents and Bubble Continuous Positive Airway Pressure for newborn resuscitation, as a study was undergoing analysis and data was not ready. Furthermore, the dataset MCSP-MNCH provided to the evaluation team was incomplete, imprecise, and contained errors, raising concerns about noted improvements.
The program’s work in male engagement and Mothers Savings and Loans Clubs hold promise for transforming gender norms but reached too few people. Most of the program’s reproductive health and MNCH interventions are likely to be included in budgets in Ebonyi and Kogi through the World Bank’s Saving One Million Lives project, but without specific commitment from the states’ governors, funding release may be jeopardized. The learning agenda helped inform implementation, but the government did not help shape the research. Last, MCSP-MNCH project created a new DHIS database instance for its project data only, including new indicators that it introduced (like application of Chlorhexidine 4% gel for newborn cord care), as well as indicators that were already available in the national DHIS 2 database; it is housed within the same server as the national DHIS 2.",PPMV Knowledge Test,['184:017__184:016__184:037'],,['Maternal and Child Health'],vcard:Contact,Janet Fennema,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,"['https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/xy3c-3gvd/files/1dd7d3a3-e5de-4ae7-be21-21c8d9226baa', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/xy3c-3gvd/files/e458fe11-0d5c-4843-86f4-bd8a0477a8aa', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/xy3c-3gvd/files/7ee9ce09-9ea9-4bba-8c73-cb09a15e3e08']",https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/xy3c-3gvd/files/2657bb5b-7357-429e-b8ae-b5123edf82fa,,,,920,,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/gkf5-q25p/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/gkf5-q25p/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/gkf5-q25p/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/gkf5-q25p/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD,,,,,,

The data was compiled as part of the Evaluation Utilization Study completed in February 2016. The study was informed by three primary data sources: document review, survey research and interviews. Evaluation use was evident at several stages in the USAID Program Cycle. At the country level, 59 percent of approved strategies were found to have referenced USAID evaluations and 71 percent of evaluations were used to support and/or modify a USAID project or activity. The most common changes found were actions that refocus ongoing activities, including revisions to delivery mechanism work plans, extending activity timelines or expanding activity geographic areas.

To combat poverty and child malnutrition, Yaajeende sought to accelerate the participation of the very poor in rural economic growth and improve the four dimensions of food security: availability, access, utilization and stability. Yaajeende worked in 790 villages across 49 municipalities (“communes” in French) and nine departments in the Matam, Tambacounda, Kédougou and Kolda regions. The project’s implementation period was November 1, 2010, to September 30, 2017.

The FIE aims to provide USAID with an evidence base on the impacts of the nutrition-led agriculture (NLA) approach that the project utilized on its key objectives, including reduced poverty and malnutrition. The findings are expected to provide accountability and learning value to USAID, including both the Senegal Mission and USAID/Feed the Future.

This report details the findings, conclusions and recommendations of a mixed-methods quasi-experimental final impact evaluation (FIE) of the United States Agency for International Development’s (USAID) $50 million, seven-year Feed the Future Nutrition-Led Agriculture Project for Food Security in Senegal, known as “Yaajeende.” The National Cooperative Business Association’s Cooperative League of the USA (NCBA CLUSA) implemented the project. To combat poverty and child malnutrition, Yaajeende sought to accelerate the participation of the very poor in rural economic growth and improve the four dimensions of food security: availability, access, utilization and stability. Yaajeende worked in 790 villages across 49 municipalities (“communes” in French) and nine departments in the Matam, Tambacounda, Kédougou and Kolda regions. The project’s implementation period was November 1, 2010, to September 30, 2017.

The FIE aims to provide USAID with an evidence base on the impacts of the nutrition-led agriculture (NLA) approach that the project utilized on its key objectives, including reduced poverty and malnutrition. The findings are expected to provide accountability and learning value to USAID, including both the Senegal Mission and USAID/Feed the Future.

In fiscal year 2012, USAID's Office of Food for Peace (FFP) awarded funding to private voluntary organizations (PVOs) to design and implement a multi-year Title II development food assistance program in Uganda.  The main purpose of the Title II program is to improve long-term food security of chronically food insecure population in the target regions.  FFP contracted a firm, ICF International to conduct a baseline study in targeted areas of the country prior to the start of the new program.  The purpose of the study was to assess the current status of key indicators, have a better understanding of prevailing conditions and perceptions of the population in the implementation areas, and serve as a point of comparison for future final evaluations.  Results would also be used to further refine program targeting and, where possible, to understand the relationship between variables to inform program design.  The study was conducted in 2013, while FFP expects to conduct final evaluations as close as possible to the end of the program five years later.

In the process of migrating data to the current DDL platform, datasets with a large number of variables required splitting into multiple spreadsheets.  They should be reassembled by the user to understand the data fully.","Baseline Study of Food for Peace Title II Development Food Assistance Program in Karamoja, Uganda--Agriculture Practices: Section 1","['184:016,184:018,184:019,184:029,184:037']",http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/legalcode,['Humanitarian Assistance'],vcard:Contact,USAID Data Services,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,,,,,,964,,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/h7kg-yxdw/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/h7kg-yxdw/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/h7kg-yxdw/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/h7kg-yxdw/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD,,,,,,

This report details the findings, conclusions and recommendations of a mixed-methods quasi-experimental final impact evaluation (FIE) of the United States Agency for International Development’s (USAID) $50 million, seven-year Feed the Future Nutrition-Led Agriculture Project for Food Security in Senegal, known as “Yaajeende.” The National Cooperative Business Association’s Cooperative League of the USA (NCBA CLUSA) implemented the project. To combat poverty and child malnutrition, Yaajeende sought to accelerate the participation of the very poor in rural economic growth and improve the four dimensions of food security: availability, access, utilization and stability. Yaajeende worked in 790 villages across 49 municipalities (“communes” in French) and nine departments in the Matam, Tambacounda, Kédougou and Kolda regions. The project’s implementation period was November 1, 2010, to September 30, 2017.

The FIE aims to provide USAID with an evidence base on the impacts of the nutrition-led agriculture (NLA) approach that the project utilized on its key objectives, including reduced poverty and malnutrition. The findings are expected to provide accountability and learning value to USAID, including both the Senegal Mission and USAID/Feed the Future.

We compared the efficacy of four chlorine solutions (sodium hypochlorite, sodium dichloroisocyanurate, high ­test hypochlorite, and generated hypochlorite) for disinfection of three surface types (stainless steel, heavy duty tarp, and nitrile), with and without pre­cleaning practices (pre­wiping and/or covering) and soil load. The test organisms were E. coli and the Ebola surrogate Phi6. All tests achieved a minimum of 5.9­ and 3.1­log removal in E. coli and Phi6, respectively. A 15­-minute exposure to 0.5% chlorine was sufficient to ensure less than 8 Phi6 PFU/cm2 in all tests. While chlorine types were equally efficacious with and without soil load, variation was seen by surface type. Wiping did not increase disinfection efficacy, and is not recommended as it generates infectious waste. Covering spills decreased disinfection efficacy against E. coli on heavy ­duty tarp but does prevent splashing, which is critical in Ebola contexts. Our results support the recommendation of a 15-minute exposure to 0.5% chlorine, independently of chlorine type, surface, pre­-cleaning practices, and organic matter, as an efficacious measure to interrupt disease transmission from uncontrolled spills in Ebola outbreaks.",Efficacy of surface disinfection using E. coli and the Ebola surrogate Phi6,['184:034'],,['Other Public Health Threats'],vcard:Contact,Lena Knezevic,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/hjah-22yn/files/8d42130b-4f16-47cd-aac7-b641381f1863,,,,984,https://data.usaid.gov/d/9btc-4i7d,,,,,,,,,,

To combat poverty and child malnutrition, Yaajeende sought to accelerate the participation of the very poor in rural economic growth and improve the four dimensions of food security: availability, access, utilization and stability. Yaajeende worked in 790 villages across 49 municipalities (“communes” in French) and nine departments in the Matam, Tambacounda, Kédougou and Kolda regions. The project’s implementation period was November 1, 2010, to September 30, 2017.

The FIE aims to provide USAID with an evidence base on the impacts of the nutrition-led agriculture (NLA) approach that the project utilized on its key objectives, including reduced poverty and malnutrition. The findings are expected to provide accountability and learning value to USAID, including both the Senegal Mission and USAID/Feed the Future.

Neutralizing antibody titers (expressed as a reciprocal) were determined by the 80% Plaque Reduction Neutralization technique (PRNT-80) at days post vaccination (DPV). 

The overall purpose of the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Rift Valley Fever Control in Agriculture is to increase the food supply by developing and applying a vaccine for the prevention of Rift Valley fever disease among livestock in Africa.  Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne viral disease that continues to have a devastating impact on human and animal health in Africa.  Since the discovery of RVF as the cause of an outbreak among sheep and humans during the early 1930s in the Rift Valley in Kenya, the disease has emerged as one of the most important zoonoses in Africa. The disease has and continues to affect the health of thousands to millions of humans and animals, and the livestock industry has lost millions of dollars, and therefore, affecting hundreds of millions of those whose livelihood depends on livestock, exaggerating poverty on already deprived communities.

The specific aim of the Lab is to conduct a 5 year research project to develop and evaluate a vaccine for the prevention of Rift Valley fever (RVF) among livestock in Tanzania and other RVF virus enzootic African regions and thereby improve food security, nutrition and livelihoods in Africa as a USAID priority under Feed the Future, the U.S. Government’s global hunger and food security initiative.

1) Characterize weed seedbank density and composition in EIGP;
2) Evaluate potential effects of zero tillage in wheat on weed seedbank communities;
3) Assess potential relationships between crop diversification and the prevalence of important weeds; and
4) Evaluate potential relationships between soil physical and chemical characteristics and weed communities

This project compiled germinable seedbank counts from 84 farmers’ fields in Bihar and Eastern Uttar Pradesh, India. Soil samples were submitted for soil texture and chemical analyses.

The overarching goal of LTTP II is to enhance pupils' learning in general, and reading proficiency in particular; establish a functional teacher professional development (PD) system; and strengthen the MOE's capacity to manage such a system. The LTTP II was originally designed to work in nine counties: Grand Gedeh, Grand Kru, Lofa, Maryland, Montserrado, Nimba, River Cess, River Gee, and Sinoe. In 2011 and 2012, because of changes in USAID policies, the number of counties was reduced to five (i.e., Bong, Lofa, Margibi, Montserrado, and Nimba), which USAID identifies as a development corridor containing a majority of the Liberian population.

The LTTP II intervention drew on the EGRA Plus model to introduce similarly structured reading and math programs in grades 1, 2, and 3 to approximately 1,020 schools in four counties (i.e., Bong, Lofa, Montserrado, and Nimba) in a phased approach. Cohort 1, the first to receive support, had 792 schools. During the middle of the 2011/2012 school year, the reading program was introduced in all three grades in these schools. During the middle of the 2012/2013 school year, the mathematics program was introduced in all three grades. Cohort 2, consisting of approximately 330 schools, began participating in the programs reading and mathematics interventions during the 2013/2014 school year and continued during the 2014/2015 school year. Some changes, although not significant, were made to the intervention approach for supporting the Cohort 2 schools.

Schools in the four LTTP II counties were randomly assigned to the Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 groupings. These schools were then grouped in clusters of 12 schools based on geographic proximity, which would allow the program to deliver the interventions more efficiently

Cohort 1: Schools from the four target counties included in Cohort 1 served as the treatment group for the midterm assessment. These schools stopped receiving LTTP II support after the midterm assessment, but they participated in the endline assessment, as a way to determine whether the gains that were achieved during the treatment were sustained.

Cohort 2: Schools included in Cohort 2 in the same four counties began to receive treatment after the midterm assessment, thus, during the final two years of the program. Cohort 2 schools served as a control to which the Cohort 1 results were compared. The performance of Cohort 2 schools were to be compared to that of Cohort 1. The biggest challenge that the program faced regarding the implementation in Cohort 2 schools was the school closings because of the Ebola crisis. Schools were closed between September 2014 and February 2015. Even after the official reopening date, with the gradual actual opening of schools that required LTTP II to wait until schools were safe to open, it took several months to distribute books to schools and to train teachers which in turn severely affected the implementation of the treatment.

External Cohort: A randomly selected sample of schools outside the four target counties served as another comparator, especially after Cohort 2 began receiving treatment alongside Cohort 1.

Except for a small number of schools associated with the RTTIs, schools outside the four target counties did not participate in the program during the lifetime of LTTP II.

Baseline demographic, agricultural production, and livelihood information was collected to describe the problem in more detail and generate a data-driven design specification for a bean threshing machine.

In total, 249 farmers in three districts of Zambia (Mbala, Luwingu and Mporokoso) participated in the survey. The Zambian government has sub-divided the northern province into eight districts. Three of these eight districts, Mbala, Mporokoso and Luwingu were enrolled in survey based on their levels of bean production, providing the study with a representative sample of bean production characteristics and challenges in the region. High (Mbala), medium (Mporokoso), and low (Luwingu) production districts were chosen, referencing annual production data collected by the Central Statistics Office (CSO, 2016). Districts are further divided into agricultural camps comprised of several villages. Three camps within each district were chosen to participate. Camps were selected based on their proximity to one another (neighboring camps were not selected) and accessibility by road. Within each camp, thirty farmers were randomly selected to participate in the research by camp officers, who act as extension agents of the Zambian Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock.","Design and Evaluation of Bicycle-Powered Bean Thresher, Zambia 2016",['184:029'],http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/legalcode,['Economic Growth'],vcard:Contact,Lena Knezevic,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,"['https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/jb2j-7vb6/files/751973ac-6a64-4d25-a332-06aee473ffe0', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/jb2j-7vb6/files/587bc241-2d48-4562-bf5e-59fe213e467f']",https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/jb2j-7vb6/files/24026860-b293-40a5-b3f6-b72b81eb866a,,,,1090,https://datahub.usaid.gov/d/28ur-x99c,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, an applicable framework may aid in Cambodian stakeholder (e.g. famers, researchers, extension agents, policy makers, etc.) understanding and adoption of integrated crop-livestock systems (FAO, 2010). In many countries the costs and benefits of integrated crop-livestock systems have been defined for staple crops (IFAD, 1999).

The main objectives are to enable USAID missions to meet the performance monitoring requirements of Feed the Future and maximize the use and benefits of data collected; provide high-­quality empirical evidence to inform program design and investment decisions that will promote sustainable food security; ensure timely availability of high­quality data for use in monitoring performance and evaluating impacts of the Feed the Future initiative; and facilitate accountability and learning about which Feed the Future interventions work best, under what conditions, and at what cost.",Malawi Baseline Impact Evaluation: Farmer Data,['184:029__184:019'],http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/legalcode,['Agriculture'],vcard:Contact,Lena Knezevic,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,"['https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/bntj-k3ea/files/aecaad93-3e30-447d-bfb1-a5aa62f9cdba', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/bntj-k3ea/files/4f1e5242-10b2-496a-a7d4-7f8a8b703225']",https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/bntj-k3ea/files/598349fb-eac5-4117-85d9-f2065297d2ed,,,,1099,,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/jfk4-x2a8/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/jfk4-x2a8/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/jfk4-x2a8/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/jfk4-x2a8/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD,,,,,,

Feed the Future’s Africa Lead II project partnered with The Mediae Company, a Kenya-based media education company, to develop a pilot season of Africa’s first agriculture-focused reality TV program: Don’t Lose the Plot (DLTP). Targeting youth in Kenya and Tanzania, the show aired in Kenya and Tanzania between May and July 2017. The program’s objectives were to encourage youth to consider farming as a lucrative career choice, provide information on how to start agribusinesses, and share useful agronomic information. Africa Lead commissioned Kantar Public East Africa to evaluate the impact of DLTP on knowledge, attitudes, and behavior, or intention to change behavior, related to farming and agribusiness practices. 

This data asset includes quantitative data collected through a cross-sectional household survey in Kenya and Tanzania. Data collection took place between August and December 2017 and targeted both viewers and non-viewers of DLTP aged 18 to 35 years. A total sample of 3,737 target individuals were interviewed in Kenya, including 406 verified viewers. In Tanzania, 3,383 target individuals were interviewed, including 527 verified viewers.","FTF ""Don't Lose the Plot"" Impact Assessment: Kenya Dataset",['184:029'],,['Agriculture'],vcard:Contact,Lena Knezevic,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,"['https://www.africaleadftf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DLTP_Evaluation_Report.pdf', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/4pgb-x3zm/files/46131aad-3aa6-4b56-9e32-e4c90694ddad', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/4pgb-x3zm/files/64d25957-4968-419a-8748-290bf8e06cf4']",https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/4pgb-x3zm/files/6fc47194-ef44-4dde-86ba-88b1e4aaba52,,,,1102,,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/jh27-jpa9/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/jh27-jpa9/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/jh27-jpa9/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/jh27-jpa9/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD,,,,,,

This file has 206 columns and 4,723 rows.  It corresponds to Module H5 of the questionnaire.  In fiscal year 2012, USAID's Office of Food for Peace (FFP) awarded funding to private voluntary organizations (PVOs) to design and implement a multi-year Title II development food assistance program in Uganda.  The main purpose of the Title II program is to improve long-term food security of chronically food insecure population in the target regions.  FFP contracted a firm, ICF International to conduct a baseline study in targeted areas of the country prior to the start of the new program.  The purpose of the study was to assess the current status of key indicators, have a better understanding of prevailing conditions and perceptions of the population in the implementation areas, and serve as a point of comparison for future final evaluations.  Results would also be used to further refine program targeting and, where possible, to understand the relationship between variables to inform program design.  The study was conducted in 2013, while FFP expects to conduct final evaluations as close as possible to the end of the program five years later.  The data asset is comprised of six datasets: 1) a description of all members of the households surveyed, 2) data on maternal health and sanitation practices, 3) data about the children in the household, 4) data describing the agricultural practices of the household, 5) data describing the food consumption of the household (broken into 4 smaller spreadsheets), and 6) and a description of the weights that should be applied during the analysis of the other datasets. In the process of migrating data to the current DDL platform, datasets with a large number of variables required splitting into multiple spreadsheets.  They should be reassembled by the user to understand the data fully.","Baseline Study of Food for Peace Title II Development Food Assistance Program in Karamoja, Uganda--Asset Value and Consumption: Section 1","['184:016,184:018,184:019,184:029,184:037']",http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/legalcode,['Humanitarian Assistance'],vcard:Contact,USAID Data Services,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,,,,,,1116,,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/jn7r-kht7/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/jn7r-kht7/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/jn7r-kht7/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/jn7r-kht7/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD,,,,,,

In order to monitor the availability of ORS and zinc and the effectiveness of its interventions to increase the supply of ORS and zinc, SHOPS Plus conducted quarterly retail audits in PPMVs and CPs in Benue and Kebbi States from October 2015 to July 2017, when SHOPS Plus ORS-zinc work in Nigeria concluded. SHOPS Plus used this data to inform the management of its ORS and zinc-related activities.

Most data are recorded every 15-minutes.

The transboundary Limpopo River Basin crosses Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa, and Zimbabwe.  At over 400,000 km2, the Limpopo River Basin is home to 18 million people living in both rural and urban areas.  Industries in the Basin include businesses in the urban areas and water-intensive uses such as agriculture and mining; industrial water use is growing rapidly (LBPTC, 2010).  In addition to the human residents, the Basin contains some of the most biodiverse natural areas on the planet (Kahinda et al., 2016).

The rainfall in the Basin is heterogeneous with some sub-basins receiving less than 400 mm on average and other downstream sub-basins in Mozambique receiving over 750 mm annually (LBPTC, 2010).  Even meteorological stations located in close proximity demonstrate substantial spatial variation within sub-basins.  The Basin has experienced severe droughts in the last decade (LBPTC, 2010).  In addition to the variation in the amount of rainfall, the timing, especially the start of the growing season, has varied significantly (Edokpayi et al., 2018).  However, there remain many questions about the reliability of rainfall data and other water measurements due in part to the infrequent calibration and validation of field site measurements.  The limited confidence in these data, combined with the substantial variation through time and space necessitates an integrated approach to improve data collection, validation, and overall Basin water resource management in the Basin.

The goal of this project is to build resilience through the support of Basin stakeholders, including The Limpopo Watercourse Commission (LIMCOM), to improve governance around water resources management and water security in the Basin.  A systems approach, such as integrated water resources management (IWRM) is needed to address such complex, large, and interrelated components of water resources. IRWM is recommended by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Water and Development Strategy Implementation Guide (2014).  This context will be combined with data collection and validation, data sharing, and continuous evaluation of the interrelations that affect water resources.  For example, surface water quality will affect ecosystem biodiversity and those who depend on those ecosystems for drinking water or fish as a food protein source.  Another example is groundwater; Petrie et al. (2014) found that groundwater in the Limpopo Basin holds great potential for increased water access; however, groundwater measurement data are currently insufficient to calculate sustainable total withdrawal rates.  With improved data collection, validation, and sharing of these data, managers will have a basis for scientifically-based decisions and may be able to utilize groundwater resources more effectively to increase (e.g., agricultural) productivity.  These same resource managers need monitoring and surveillance tools to measure water consumption by users within the basin, how demand and use changes through time, and to understand if historic and current sparse monitoring is accurate.  Since rural users withdraw water in informal schemes, measurements of water use currently do not exist.
This project will support water resources monitoring, and the development of methods for water quality and quantity measurement based on in situ sensors and satellite measurements.  These measurements will enable characterization of water resource dynamics at the whole Basin scale and form the foundation for hydrologic modeling that can help estimate hard-to-measure parameters and also provide holistic assessments of Basin scale stocks and flows.  To support data sharing, the project will use cloud-based, automated data collection and web-based data sharing.  All sensors and data will be shared.

In total, the team conducted surveys with 1,640 unique teachers, and completed 637 direct classroom observations to record teachers’ instruction practices in the classroom.",Endline Evaluation of Transparency and Professional Norms in Uganda 2018,['184:008'],http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/legalcode,['Good Governance'],vcard:Contact,Lena Knezevic,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,"['https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/krwz-4s5h/files/932e27f8-8625-4dc1-900c-e55392bd5aa1', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/krwz-4s5h/files/4b0c660a-55bd-458d-9563-eab2b3ae9da1', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/krwz-4s5h/files/d7d0273e-8772-4d2c-956f-08a83c3e46bc', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/krwz-4s5h/files/625c3d31-4404-47a0-91d6-df861c6d42b1', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/krwz-4s5h/files/16fc0a33-f974-47bc-b5d3-e82287562e46', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/krwz-4s5h/files/6858cd91-f7ab-46f9-bc11-37c7fff67957', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/krwz-4s5h/files/62e80ef7-aa1e-4024-a0cb-44efaba7b134']",https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/krwz-4s5h/files/a5c933ec-6ce4-418f-8356-a21cc6fa1d56,,,,1191,https://datahub.usaid.gov/d/p29m-trkw,,,,,,,,,,

To combat poverty and child malnutrition, Yaajeende sought to accelerate the participation of the very poor in rural economic growth and improve the four dimensions of food security: availability, access, utilization and stability. Yaajeende worked in 790 villages across 49 municipalities (“communes” in French) and nine departments in the Matam, Tambacounda, Kédougou and Kolda regions. The project’s implementation period was November 1, 2010, to September 30, 2017.

The FIE aims to provide USAID with an evidence base on the impacts of the nutrition-led agriculture (NLA) approach that the project utilized on its key objectives, including reduced poverty and malnutrition. The findings are expected to provide accountability and learning value to USAID, including both the Senegal Mission and USAID/Feed the Future.

Conceived as a learning activity, RFS-SSE developed an evidence base of effective approaches that improve reading skills in targeted primary schools. RFS-SSE began when the MOEVT was developing a 15-year education reform called Vision 2030 as well as a set of medium-term activities for the period 2015-2020. Reform efforts addressed a key weakness in the Moroccan educational system: poor reading skills at the primary level. The RFS-SSE intervention helped to inform the revisions to the existing curriculum and the design of the reformed curriculum by providing data and evidence to support the envisioned changes. 

To assess the impact of the RFS-SSE reading program, RFS-SSE selected a longitudinal evaluation design which included reading assessments of two cohorts of students. Cohort 1 was assessed at four different times - the middle of Grade 1 and throughout Grade 2: Baseline (January 2016), Midline 1 (May 2016), Midline 2 (September 2016), and Endline (May 2017). Cohort 2 was assessed twice – the beginning and end of Grade 1: Midline 2 (September 2016) and Endline (May 2017). A stratified cluster random sampling method was used to assure that (1) an equal number of boys and girls in urban and rural schools would be assessed and (2) that the results of the study would be generalizable to the entire population of intervention schools in each of the eight delegations selected for intervention. Schools were first stratified by geographic location and urban/rural environment. Within schools, students were stratified by gender.

Data was collected in the two districts between December 2018 and April 2019. First, the study team enumerated all eligible maternal and neonatal deaths in the study areas using a proven method for counting these mortality events, known as Maternal Death from Informant/Maternal Death Follow-on Review (MADE-IN/MADE-FOR) and Neonatal Death from Informant/ Neonatal Death Follow-on Review (NODE-IN/NODE-FOR).

SCIP is aligned to the USAID Global Education Strategy (2011–2015) which supports interventions to improve learning outcomes with a focus on primary grade reading as a measure of performance.

Little is known about the genetic basis underlying these changes. In this study, 215 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between a cultivated and a wild cowpea accession were used to evaluate nine domestication-related traits (pod shattering, peduncle length, flower color, days to flowering, 100-seed weight, pod length, leaf length, leaf width and seed number per pod). A high-density genetic map containing 17,739 single nucleotide polymorphisms was constructed and used to identify 16 quantitative trait loci (QTL) for these nine traits. Based on annotations of the cowpea reference genome, genes within these regions are reported. Four regions with clusters of QTL were identified, including one on chromosome 8 related to increased organ size. This study provides new knowledge of the genomic regions controlling domestication-related traits in cowpea as well as candidate genes underlying those QTL.

Under the grant, UNICEF established a three-tiered social mobilization structure that included: 1) 128 neighborhood committees, designed to raise awareness of WASH behaviors and garner support for WASH-related activities; 2) 16 ward committees, designed to compile grievances and concerns raised by the neighborhood committees and communicate these concerns to service providers; and 3) a city forum comprised of civil society activists and neighborhood committees, which serves as a platform for citizens to voice concerns to service providers and communicate directly with the city government.
To support these activities, UNICEF, in collaboration with UN-Habitat, conducted two surveys: 1) a baseline household survey of WASH services and behaviors in Jacobabad city, and 2) a “Willingness to Pay for WASH Services” survey.",Jacobabad Urban WASH Assessment: Community Mobilization for Health and Hygiene,['184:018__184:013__184:015'],http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/legalcode,['Water Supply and Sanitation'],vcard:Contact,Lena Knezevic,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,"['https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/mja2-zesr/files/5e995e53-1cad-4d0a-810d-3ce970a2b124', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/mja2-zesr/files/fd8f57c8-4cae-4afc-b1ad-df129bbab8fc', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/mja2-zesr/files/d4e42fb7-5a1c-4401-8d5a-0c9a91d29860', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/mja2-zesr/files/40f3711e-cd19-4d6c-acd0-807fd5e84086']",https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/mja2-zesr/files/f84c592c-111d-4225-930c-66db0e103ff7,,,,1254,,,,,,,,,,,

The main purpose of the Title II program is to improve long-term food security of chronically food insecure population in the target regions.  FFP contracted a firm, ICF International to conduct a baseline study in targeted areas of the country prior to the start of the new program.  The purpose of the study was to assess the current status of key indicators, have a better understanding of prevailing conditions and perceptions of the population in the implementation areas, and serve as a point of comparison for future final evaluations.  Results would also be used to further refine program targeting and, where possible, to understand the relationship between variables to inform program design.  The study was conducted in 2013, while FFP expects to conduct final evaluations as close as possible to the end of the program five years later.

To build an affordable solution for large volume, agricultural applications, we are developing a technology that relies on industrial-scale, inexpensive, and non-toxic materials known as ion-exchange resins (IERs). IERs are widely used for water- softening and require regular chemical regeneration using corrosive chemicals. Instead, in this innovation, the IER are embedded in conductive-composite electrodes and electrically regenerated—a method free of chemical input. This new method is referred to as electrically regenerated ion-exchange (ERI) technology. Besides the reduced cost, the composite electrodes used in ERI also allow for unique operational modes: salt capture without any energy input and salt rejection with minimal energy input. ERI technology has been successfully demonstrated in the lab using a prototype unit and is well positioned to treat a wide variety of influent water salinities and flow rates. The current ERI prototype has 100 centimeters squared (cm2) electrode area and an output flow rate of 10 milliliters per minute (mL/min) for feedwater salinities for just 100 parts per million (ppm) of sodium chloride (NaCl). The ability of the system to treat higher salinity feedwaters, similar to those encountered in the field, and to have higher output flow rates are both tied to the electrode area—modular design that allows for easy scalability.",Cyclic Voltammeter Scans—Electrically Regenerated Ion-Exchange (ERI) Technology: Leveraging Faradaic Reactions and Assessing the Effect of Co-Ion Sorption,['184:018'],http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode,['Water Supply and Sanitation'],vcard:Contact,"Laura Hjerpe, USAID Data Services Team",mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,,,,,,1268,https://osf.io/ehras/,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of soil properties and soil classification in the resulting dataset of 468 sites by land use, landscape position, and elevation revealed important relationships relevant for management and land use planning. These sites occurred across a range of landscape positions and an elevation gradient from 1040 – 2240 m.a.s.l. Soil diversity at the U.S. Order and WRB Reference Group levels was higher than expected, with five U.S. soil orders and seven WRB Reference Groups described in the dataset, and the highest soil diversity occurring at lower landscape positions. We found that soil organic carbon (SOC) and pH were two master variables that were correlated most other soil properties. Sites under cultivated land uses had the lowest topsoil soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations, and SOC generally increased with increasing elevation. Mature forest and charcoal production areas did not significantly differ in their depth distributions of SOC. Valley soils had significantly lower surface SOC concentrations but higher exchangeable bases and pH values than all other landscape positions. Soil pH decreased by an average of 3.5 units across the entire elevation gradient and decreased by 1 unit with elevation even after SOC, land use and landscape position were included in multiple regression models. Local pedotransfer functions were developed to assist with the use of pH, clay and SOC as proxies for more difficult to measure soil properties such as cation exchange capacity (CEC) and base saturation (B.S.), bulk density and total phosphorus.

Managed by World Education, Inc. (WEI), ApaL works closely with the Ministry of Education in Mozambique (MINED) to improve the quality and increase the quantity of reading instruction. The program includes teacher training, coaching and support in improved reading instruction methods, and school management training, coaching and support for school directors.

ApaL began with delivery of the program in 35 Zonas de Influencia Pedagogica (ZIPs) in six districts along the economic corridors of the provinces of Nampula and Zambézia. ZIPs are formed by one “head” school and a cluster of five, ten or more schools. The “head” school of a ZIP is usually better organized than the surrounding schools and is tasked with reporting to the district and receiving and distributing teaching material and resources that are sent by the MINED. The “head” of the ZIP schools also serve as an example and a magnet for training and improvement of the surrounding schools. Based on experience during initial implementation, expansion to approximately five hundred schools in the area was anticipated, and in 2015, ApaL expanded to 538 schools. USAID selected these provinces because at the time of program design, they contained 42 percent of the school age population of Mozambique. At the beginning of the 2013 school year, 180 schools clustered around the 35 ZIPs in the two provinces were randomly assigned by the IE to three groups – 60 schools to Full treatment, 60 to Medium treatment, and 60 to a no-treatment or Control group.

There have been four stages of reading assessment: (1) Baseline data collection and analysis at the beginning of the 2013 school year prior to program implementation; (2) Midline 1, near the end of the 2013 school year, after two or three months of implementation; (3) Midline 2, after a full year of implementation, 2014; and (4) the 2015 endline study.",Aprender a Ler Mozambique,['184:020'],http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/legalcode,['Basic Education'],vcard:Contact,Adam Weber,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,"['https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/nq4p-qp97/files/61ae1788-b95a-45a9-b0de-9420585ac0cb', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/nq4p-qp97/files/1d117199-7c94-42e7-9237-b593eb2c4b5e', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/nq4p-qp97/files/4788f06f-f7d3-4313-aca2-b30af50a677a', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/nq4p-qp97/files/b44cbee5-db8d-413e-898f-40ab95fe8a59', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/nq4p-qp97/files/d94cf240-ac96-4349-9a9f-ee63b09ab5d7', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/nq4p-qp97/files/c40ed25a-f306-460a-879d-807c2d72c28f', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/nq4p-qp97/files/d22e52b5-f5c0-482c-8783-04ad1638312b', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/nq4p-qp97/files/57f6c42d-9f8b-49d2-adbe-b7dae80ebb59']",,,,,1330,https://datahub.usaid.gov/d/yud4-2tdz,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of soil properties and soil classification in the resulting dataset of 468 sites by land use, landscape position, and elevation revealed important relationships relevant for management and land use planning. These sites occurred across a range of landscape positions and an elevation gradient from 1040 – 2240 m.a.s.l. Soil diversity at the U.S. Order and WRB Reference Group levels was higher than expected, with five U.S. soil orders and seven WRB Reference Groups described in the dataset, and the highest soil diversity occurring at lower landscape positions. We found that soil organic carbon (SOC) and pH were two master variables that were correlated most other soil properties. Sites under cultivated land uses had the lowest topsoil soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations, and SOC generally increased with increasing elevation. Mature forest and charcoal production areas did not significantly differ in their depth distributions of SOC. Valley soils had significantly lower surface SOC concentrations but higher exchangeable bases and pH values than all other landscape positions. Soil pH decreased by an average of 3.5 units across the entire elevation gradient and decreased by 1 unit with elevation even after SOC, land use and landscape position were included in multiple regression models. Local pedotransfer functions were developed to assist with the use of pH, clay and SOC as proxies for more difficult to measure soil properties such as cation exchange capacity (CEC) and base saturation (B.S.), bulk density and total phosphorus. Phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) were
identified as the most likely limiting nutrients in West Usambaran plateau soils in general.

To combat poverty and child malnutrition, Yaajeende sought to accelerate the participation of the very poor in rural economic growth and improve the four dimensions of food security: availability, access, utilization and stability. Yaajeende worked in 790 villages across 49 municipalities (“communes” in French) and nine departments in the Matam, Tambacounda, Kédougou and Kolda regions. The project’s implementation period was November 1, 2010, to September 30, 2017.

The FIE aims to provide USAID with an evidence base on the impacts of the nutrition-led agriculture (NLA) approach that the project utilized on its key objectives, including reduced poverty and malnutrition. The findings are expected to provide accountability and learning value to USAID, including both the Senegal Mission and USAID/Feed the Future.

The sampling design provided for estimates for urban and rural areas and the Municipality of Phnom Penh. The 2008 Population Census of Cambodia was used as sampling frame (NIS, 2010). The sampling design in the CSES 2009 survey is a three­stage design. In stage one, a sample of villages is selected using systematic sampling. In stage two, an Enumeration Area (EA) is selected from each village selected in stage one using Simple Random Sampling (SRS). Finally, in stage three, a sample of households is selected from each EA by systematic sampling. For the generation of the relevant Baseline indicators we used the sample for the four FtF provinces, with a total of 2,453 households (2,096 in rural and 357 in urban areas). The CSES collects a wide range of data related to household living conditions, income generation and expenditures. 

(b) Demographic and Health Survey (CDHS): The Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey (CDHS, 2010) is a nationally representative sample survey of 18,754 women and 8,239 men age 15­49. The 2010 CDHS is the third comprehensive survey conducted in Cambodia as part of the worldwide MEASURE DHS project. The primary purpose of the CDHS is to provide policymakers and planners with up­-to-date, reliable data on fertility; family planning; infant, child, and maternal mortality; maternal and child health; nutrition; malaria; knowledge of HIV/AIDS, and women’s status. The sampling frame used for the 2010 CDHS was the complete list of all villages enumerated in the 2008 Cambodia General Population Census provided by the NIS. The survey was based on a stratified sample selected in two stages. In the first stage, 611 EAs were selected with probability proportional to size. The household listings provided the frame from which households were selected in the second stage. To ensure a sample size large enough to calculate reliable estimates for each study domain, it was necessary to restrict the total number of households selected to 24 in each urban EA and 28 in each rural EA. For the purposes of generating the Cambodia Feed ­the Future Indicators, we use the CDHS 2010 survey sample for the four provinces that make the Zone of Influence, in which 1,814 were respondents of all non­pregnant women in reproductive age (15­49 years); 1,796 women in reproductive age with anemia measurement (15­49 years); 78 children 0­5 months; 736 children 0­59 months; 634 children 6­59 months with hemoglobin measurement.",Feed the Future Cambodia: Zone of Influence Baseline Report,['184:029'],https://www.usa.gov/government-works,['Agriculture'],vcard:Contact,Lena Knezevic,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,['https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/nz8k-s45e/files/3028af89-3d39-49c1-8240-ed7dbdcc9474'],https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/nz8k-s45e/files/0f88ac2f-ed81-490e-82cb-b972a4420491,,,,1348,,,,,,,,,,,

FFP contracted a firm, ICF International to conduct a baseline study in targeted areas of the country prior to the start of the new program.  The purpose of the study was to assess the current status of key indicators, have a better understanding of prevailing conditions and perceptions of the population in the implementation areas, and serve as a point of comparison for future final evaluations.  Results would also be used to further refine program targeting and, where possible, to understand the relationship between variables to inform program design.

The questions include issues concerning ECP availability, ECP usage, knowledge, practices, perception, influencers, usage patterns of ECP, policy and stakeholders' opinion and views of ECP, and the relationship between the usage of ECP and Modern Method Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (MCPR).
This was a mixed method study. Stakeholders data was mostly qualitative whereas pharmacy, user, and buyer data was predominantly quantitative with few unstructured questions. 
The study was done in 11 districts of Nepal and a total of 305 ECP users, 306 ECP buyers, 122 pharmacies and 56 stakeholders were interviewed. Interviews were carried out face-to-face with data collected on paper questionnaire among pharmacies, buyers, or users of ECP visiting the pharmacies, and users referred by the buyers of ECP. The answers were based on self-reported response. 
The survey was conducted in 3rd week of June 2018 and completed on 3rd week of August (2 months) and the study is conducted by CAMRIS International. 
A consultation meeting with pharmacies and their district level chapter association was carried out followed by collaboration with the ECP pharmacies. Based on the sample frame (buyer/user list) visiting the pharmacies to buy the ECP, buyers and users were selected and interviewed after taking consent.",An Assessment of Emergency Contraceptive Pills (ECP) in Nepal 2018,['184:017__184:016__184:037'],http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/legalcode,['Family Planning and Reproductive Health'],vcard:Contact,"Laura Hjerpe, USAID Data Services Team",mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,"['https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/p8mb-4wuc/files/0e1c0f14-0c5e-4b05-b3d9-46b4c116218c', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/p8mb-4wuc/files/2555a04a-591b-45a3-81ab-e1506671e0ab', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/p8mb-4wuc/files/32016084-94cc-48d5-8247-7d20148f79f5', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/p8mb-4wuc/files/7be1171f-905b-419e-98bc-5399c6dd4e53', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/p8mb-4wuc/files/85e6057e-c308-42f3-b6a7-ca934633f58f', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/p8mb-4wuc/files/9a8dab31-61f4-443f-8dc0-4dd969b87dc0', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/p8mb-4wuc/files/9b9570fa-feba-40dc-9819-df73a4593a0e', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/p8mb-4wuc/files/b186931e-b8cb-4033-9795-93b3e4aeea54', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/p8mb-4wuc/files/c0b12abc-3eee-42ca-b625-2e66f223a93b', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/p8mb-4wuc/files/e249013c-68bb-48fd-9c86-164c62ef5ef1', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/p8mb-4wuc/files/e9484cb7-ce6d-47f1-80a1-31565256e5b7', 'https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00X16X.pdf', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/p8mb-4wuc/files/f3662adb-4b77-49c2-897d-cdbcea7e97c4', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/p8mb-4wuc/files/fdc16ffa-cfa7-4b21-ba09-f68e883474f2']",https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/p8mb-4wuc/files/e5b71493-6a34-4d1e-8412-c45bfe2fc23e,,,,1362,https://data.usaid.gov/d/6b66-nvdd,,,,,,,,,,

The overall purpose of the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Rift Valley Fever Control in Agriculture is to increase the food supply by developing and applying a vaccine for the prevention of Rift Valley fever disease among livestock in Africa.  Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne viral disease that continues to have a devastating impact on human and animal health in Africa.  Since the discovery of RVF as the cause of an outbreak among sheep and humans during the early 1930s in the Rift Valley in Kenya, the disease has emerged as one of the most important zoonoses in Africa. The disease has and continues to affect the health of thousands to millions of humans and animals, and the livestock industry has lost millions of dollars, and therefore, affecting hundreds of millions of those whose livelihood depends on livestock, exaggerating poverty on already deprived communities.

The specific aim of the Lab is to conduct a 5 year research project to develop and evaluate a vaccine for the prevention of Rift Valley fever (RVF) among livestock in Tanzania and other RVF virus enzootic African regions and thereby improve food security, nutrition and livelihoods in Africa as a USAID priority under Feed the Future, the U.S. Government’s global hunger and food security initiative.

Five questions evaluated increases in access and utilization of reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health interventions; gender-transformative strategies; sustainability; the program’s learning agenda vis-à-vis the Nigerian government’s learning needs; and use of program data.
The evaluation team used a retrospective analytic and a cross-sectional design to address the five questions, and mixed methods were used for data collection, including reviews of the national District Health Information System (DHIS) 2, MCSP-MNCH datasets, and 51 program documents.
Apparent improvements were noted in the utilization of six interventions: oxytocin, partograph, Chlorhexidine 4% gel, newborn resuscitation, essential newborn care, and integrated Community Case Management, particularly with referral of danger signs. MCSP-MNCH baseline data was not available nor calculable for magnesium sulphate or Kangaroo Mother Care. Data was also not available for postpartum family planning for first-time parents and Bubble Continuous Positive Airway Pressure for newborn resuscitation, as a study was undergoing analysis and data was not ready. Furthermore, the dataset MCSP-MNCH provided to the evaluation team was incomplete, imprecise, and contained errors, raising concerns about noted improvements.
The program’s work in male engagement and Mothers Savings and Loans Clubs hold promise for transforming gender norms but reached too few people. Most of the program’s reproductive health and MNCH interventions are likely to be included in budgets in Ebonyi and Kogi through the World Bank’s Saving One Million Lives project, but without specific commitment from the states’ governors, funding release may be jeopardized. The learning agenda helped inform implementation, but the government did not help shape the research. Last, MCSP-MNCH project created a new DHIS database instance for its project data only, including new indicators that it introduced (like application of Chlorhexidine 4% gel for newborn cord care), as well as indicators that were already available in the national DHIS 2 database; it is housed within the same server as the national DHIS 2.",Sustainability Tool,['184:017__184:016__184:037'],,['Maternal and Child Health'],vcard:Contact,Janet Fennema,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,"['https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/xy3c-3gvd/files/1dd7d3a3-e5de-4ae7-be21-21c8d9226baa', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/xy3c-3gvd/files/e458fe11-0d5c-4843-86f4-bd8a0477a8aa', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/xy3c-3gvd/files/7ee9ce09-9ea9-4bba-8c73-cb09a15e3e08']",https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/xy3c-3gvd/files/2657bb5b-7357-429e-b8ae-b5123edf82fa,,,,1379,,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/pfjy-6f9f/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/pfjy-6f9f/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/pfjy-6f9f/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/pfjy-6f9f/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD,,,,,,

The EGRA was conducted in five target provinces (Eastern, Muchinga, North-Western, Southern and Western Provinces). The purpose of the 2018 baseline EGRA is to establish a baseline level from which changes in Grade 2 learners’ performance in the core reading skills can be tracked over time. Each assessment contained seven subtasks, which included; (1) listening comprehension in both the LoI and in English; (2) letter sound identification in the LoI; (3) syllable sound identification in the LoI; (4) non-word reading in the LoI; (5) oral reading fluency in the LoI; (6) reading comprehension in the LoI and; (7) English vocabulary. In addition, assessors also administered a Snapshot of School Management and Effectiveness (SSME), which included head teacher, teacher, and learner questionnaires, along with a school inventory, to establish school characteristics and learner demographics in the sampled schools. The 2018 Baseline EGRA used a stratified sampling methodology to randomly select a representative sample of 816 schools from the five target provinces.

In the study area, four districts of Nampula province, farmers are generally far from towns where agricultural input providers are based and formal banking services are not available. Lacking these services, smallholders typically face liquidity constraints during the planting season when returns to input usage are the highest. In order to explore potential policy solutions to this challenge, the project combined training and incentives to use mobile money technology alongside targeted input marketing visits to promote formal saving strategies and increase take-up of basic inputs, primarily seeds, and fertilizer. The goal of the pilot project was to determine whether combining group-level trainings in mobile money technology with targeted direct marketing could increase input usage, and consequently boost agricultural productivity. In collaboration with Vodacom, IFPRI organized a series of trainings, first at the individual level with farm group leaders carried out in Nampula city in June 2014.

MYB domain proteins have been shown in other species to control expression of genes encoding enzymes for the final steps in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. PCR analysis indicated that a presence/absence variation of one or more MYB113 genes may control the presence or absence of black pigment.

This is being accomplished through support to innovative, local interventions that have a demonstrated capacity for scale-up. The main USAID/SA program is the School Capacity and Innovation Program (SCIP), which also leverages significant private sector resources, amplifying the impact of USAID’s investment in the South African education system. SCIP is co-funded by The ELMA Foundation and J.P. Morgan and designed in collaboration with the South African Department of Basic Education. SCIP supports local South African models or interventions that work directly with teachers and school management teams in innovative ways in order to improve their practice as instructional leaders and managers. SCIP is aligned to the USAID Global Education Strategy (2011–2015) which supports interventions to improve learning outcomes with a focus on primary grade reading as a measure of performance. In addition to seeking initiatives that demonstrate innovation and impact, sustainability and scalability are key components of the SCIP program.

The goal of the kaMhinga Literacy Project is to demonstrate that the combination of teacher training and community-based teacher support can sustainably achieve primary grade reading levels at a 60% learner literacy level. This will be done through activities aimed at developing the capacity of teachers.

Each year of implementation, Njira conducted an annual beneficiary-based survey to assess whether the project was on track for achieving the intended outcomes for direct beneficiaries. Survey results were utilized to inform program performance, adjust interventions where appropriate, and meet donor reporting requirements.

Basa assisted the implementation of transformative literacy practices in selected divisions of Regions 1 and 7 by providing teacher and student materials, training teachers and school heads, and providing post-training support for Grade 1, 2 and 3 teachers, as well as providing Early Language, Literacy and Numeracy training to kindergarten teachers.

The Basa Pilipinas activity used a quasi-experimental cross-sectional design to evaluate the impact of the treatment in improving reading and comprehension skills. Sampling was conducted at three levels: school, classrooms, and student. The school sample was drawn randomly from the activity’s five provinces. Within each school, one grade 2 classroom was selected randomly for baseline and midline with an additional grade 3 classroom selected during the endline. Within each classroom, students were randomly selected to be administered the assessment. A total of 469 students were sample from 40 schools in two provinces at the baseline (comparison), 1,216 students were sampled from 80 schools in five provinces at the midline (intervention 1), and 1,658 students were sampled from 5 provinces at the endline (intervention 2). 

The disparity in the number of provinces sampled is due to the expansion of the intervention from two provinces to five provinces starting at the midline to provide a more complete picture of the Basa outcomes. To enable the computation of estimates of literacy skills among students in all schools affected by the Basa intervention, design weights were applied to the analyses of EGRA data. Design weights were applied to compensate for differences in provincial sampling and to ensure an appropriate representation of learners in all provinces in the sample.",Read Philippines,['184:020'],http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/legalcode,['Basic Education'],vcard:Contact,Adam Weber,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,"['https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/q3gb-m8cd/files/d57d7910-2bce-443e-a857-80bb76e03db2', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/q3gb-m8cd/files/d63ce1d8-bbd8-456a-a045-0c0c95fc13f0', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/q3gb-m8cd/files/bbae11ff-0255-4ac8-9537-c476c26b5f0a', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/q3gb-m8cd/files/11c241a7-3f03-44ad-8c7e-28547e0e4964', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/q3gb-m8cd/files/55e37803-9884-4f8e-9995-559cd38bdfad', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/q3gb-m8cd/files/41d1dce9-e3ca-422f-a33a-8238f037c37c', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/q3gb-m8cd/files/55f8ca9c-470e-4592-847b-eeb8dc6f01a3', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/q3gb-m8cd/files/904f85cf-7167-476d-97c6-ef8909679722', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/q3gb-m8cd/files/db1692a2-ad55-44ac-96c2-133d4a4645e9', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/q3gb-m8cd/files/69e778f9-36be-4994-bde3-baa308e7d8f9', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/q3gb-m8cd/files/f3ed58b0-1de3-4c69-8cfc-09da0e95eb98', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/q3gb-m8cd/files/16fce067-b6b8-4a46-89c5-f24a706f3cf0', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/q3gb-m8cd/files/49b9c6bd-04e7-4672-9e43-9cfd49d24424', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/q3gb-m8cd/files/1969697c-72c9-4c85-b758-ce93d6a85f6b', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/q3gb-m8cd/files/4d17f3bb-24ed-4a92-a1f1-d54c6b10dced']",,,,,1418,https://datahub.usaid.gov/d/4f6h-ags6,,,,,,,,,,

Feed the Future’s Africa Lead II project partnered with The Mediae Company, a Kenya-based media education company, to develop a pilot season of Africa’s first agriculture-focused reality TV program: Don’t Lose the Plot (DLTP). Targeting youth in Kenya and Tanzania, the show aired in Kenya and Tanzania between May and July 2017. The program’s objectives were to encourage youth to consider farming as a lucrative career choice, provide information on how to start agribusinesses, and share useful agronomic information. Africa Lead commissioned Kantar Public East Africa to evaluate the impact of DLTP on knowledge, attitudes, and behavior, or intention to change behavior, related to farming and agribusiness practices. 

This data asset includes quantitative data collected through a cross-sectional household survey in Kenya and Tanzania. Data collection took place between August and December 2017 and targeted both viewers and non-viewers of DLTP aged 18 to 35 years. A total sample of 3,737 target individuals were interviewed in Kenya, including 406 verified viewers. In Tanzania, 3,383 target individuals were interviewed, including 527 verified viewers.","FTF ""Don't Lose the Plot"" Impact Assessment: Tanzania Dataset",['184:029'],,['Agriculture'],vcard:Contact,Lena Knezevic,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,"['https://www.africaleadftf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DLTP_Evaluation_Report.pdf', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/4pgb-x3zm/files/46131aad-3aa6-4b56-9e32-e4c90694ddad', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/4pgb-x3zm/files/64d25957-4968-419a-8748-290bf8e06cf4']",https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/4pgb-x3zm/files/6fc47194-ef44-4dde-86ba-88b1e4aaba52,,,,1431,,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/qahj-fxcx/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/qahj-fxcx/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/qahj-fxcx/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/qahj-fxcx/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD,,,,,,

This report details the findings, conclusions and recommendations of a mixed-methods quasi-experimental final impact evaluation (FIE) of the United States Agency for International Development’s (USAID) $50 million, seven-year Feed the Future Nutrition-Led Agriculture Project for Food Security in Senegal, known as “Yaajeende.” The National Cooperative Business Association’s Cooperative League of the USA (NCBA CLUSA) implemented the project. To combat poverty and child malnutrition, Yaajeende sought to accelerate the participation of the very poor in rural economic growth and improve the four dimensions of food security: availability, access, utilization and stability. Yaajeende worked in 790 villages across 49 municipalities (“communes” in French) and nine departments in the Matam, Tambacounda, Kédougou and Kolda regions. The project’s implementation period was November 1, 2010, to September 30, 2017.

Together with Emmanuel International (EI), the project aimed to reduce chronic malnutrition and food insecurity, and well as build resilience among vulnerable populations in Balaka and Machinga Districts through layered nutrition, health, WASH, agriculture, livelihoods, environmental, and risk reduction interventions.

Each year of implementation, Njira conducted an annual beneficiary-based survey to assess whether the project was on track for achieving the intended outcomes for direct beneficiaries. Survey results were utilized to inform program performance, adjust interventions where appropriate, and meet donor reporting requirements.
The survey had 3 components with differing sample frames: agriculture, health, and a general, the latter of which included any Njira participant in its sample frame and focused on a variety of topics. More details are included in the protocol.

From 2017 - 2019, the annual survey questionnaires and protocol were nearly identical so direct comparisons across annual periods can be warranted, with the exception that data collection for 2017 and 2018 surveys occurred in September/October, and data collection for the 2019 survey occurred in June.

The USAID/Malawi funded program was implemented starting August of 2013, by RTI (Research Triangle Institute) International. The MEGRA educational program was implemented alongside a Feed the Future project called Integrating Nutrition in Value Chains (INVC) and a Global Health Initiative project called Support for Service Delivery Integration (SSDI), both of which were also expected to affect the success of learners in school. Through this interconnected strategy, USAID/Malawi aimed to have a greater impact on outcomes of interest (such as learning reading scores) than would otherwise be possible through one project alone. The key elements of the MEGRA reading intervention involved:

•	Conduct teacher training, including practicums

•	Provide scripted lesson plans to teachers

•	Provide in-service teacher support and mentoring (or coaching)

•	Provide rewards for high-performing teachers and schools

•	Develop and distribute books, story cards, letter cards, and bookshelves

•	Organize reading fairs and other events to engage parents, caregivers, and the community in learner learning

•	Invite parents to participate in their learners’ classrooms and/or become engaged in extracurricular activities

•	Ensure a supportive policy environment by attending the Basic Education Technical Working Group and writing Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) to gain necessary Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology(MoEST) support and buy-in

•	Facilitate the extension of school instructional time

In order to test possible complementary or multiplier effects of the MEGRA reading intervention and the INVC and SSDI activities, all three interventions were implemented in and evaluated for four distinct treatment levels:

•	Treatment Level 1: Three focus districts (Balaka, Machinga, and Lilongwe Rural) that provide an opportunity to evaluate the impact of a fully-integrated development approach with multiple activities across sectors, including MEGRA, INVC, and SSDI, on early grade reading outcomes.

•	Treatment Level 2: The district (Salima) where MEGRA overlaps with only the SSDI intervention. This serves as a test ground for the hypothesis that synergies between education and health initiatives catalyze changes that are greater than the sum of their parts.

•	Treatment Level 3: The district (Ntcheu) where MEGRA overlaps with only the INVC intervention. This serves as a test ground for the development hypothesis that synergies between education and agricultural livelihood and nutrition initiatives catalyze changes that are greater than the sum of their parts.

•	Treatment Level 4: Five districts (Blantyre Rural, Mzimba North, Ntchisi, Thyolo, and Zomba Rural) that only receive the MEGRA initiative. These districts are used to test the MEGRA theory of change that education support leads to improved literacy and general education outcomes.

MEGRA was implemented at the zonal level, at baseline in 2013, where zones were randomly selected in each of the four levels to implement the MEGRA intervention (taking into account areas where INVC and SSDI were already working). However, since INVC and SSDI were not randomly assigned at baseline, the evaluation can only be able to determine whether EGRA is better than no EGRA and whether EGRA plus INVC and SSDI is better than no treatment.

While MEGRA expected to include both treatment and comparison schools in each district at each level, at baseline, it was unable to because the SSDI and INVC activities were already underway. As such, the program found that in the Level 2 district, Salima, it was impossible to select comparison zones that were not already contaminated with the SSDI intervention because SSDI was already work",Early Grade Reading Activity Malawi 2013 EGRA Baseline,['184:020'],http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/legalcode,['Basic Education'],vcard:Contact,Lena Knezevic,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,"['https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/sd2z-if6c/files/d7435723-8c95-40e9-b6c3-f21bb3668ede', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/sd2z-if6c/files/6305a593-f9f9-482d-b237-a632a1679f50']",https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/sd2z-if6c/files/0a4db23b-ee0f-46de-8792-5a38e4c0dae6,,,,1557,,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/sd2z-if6c/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/sd2z-if6c/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/sd2z-if6c/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/sd2z-if6c/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD,,,,,,

This report details the findings, conclusions and recommendations of a mixed-methods quasi-experimental final impact evaluation (FIE) of the United States Agency for International Development’s (USAID) $50 million, seven-year Feed the Future Nutrition-Led Agriculture Project for Food Security in Senegal, known as “Yaajeende.” The National Cooperative Business Association’s Cooperative League of the USA (NCBA CLUSA) implemented the project. To combat poverty and child malnutrition, Yaajeende sought to accelerate the participation of the very poor in rural economic growth and improve the four dimensions of food security: availability, access, utilization and stability. Yaajeende worked in 790 villages across 49 municipalities (“communes” in French) and nine departments in the Matam, Tambacounda, Kédougou and Kolda regions. The project’s implementation period was November 1, 2010, to September 30, 2017.

The FIE aims to provide USAID with an evidence base on the impacts of the nutrition-led agriculture (NLA) approach that the project utilized on its key objectives, including reduced poverty and malnutrition. The findings are expected to provide accountability and learning value to USAID, including both the Senegal Mission and USAID/Feed the Future. Additional stakeholders include the Government of Senegal, implementing partners and other agencies, donors and practitioners active in nutrition, health, agriculture and integrated sectors.",Feed the Future Senegal: Yaajeende Women's Data,['184:029__184:019__184:018'],,['Economic Growth'],vcard:Contact,Lena Knezevic,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,"['https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/hux8-4ppy/files/206b7b05-a561-4e69-b4c5-2aaf4edef851', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/hux8-4ppy/files/679ad07a-24ba-435f-b5cb-9827dfb0c58e', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/hux8-4ppy/files/d8d1f5d1-e4c6-4095-8ed1-43f71031ba61']",https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/hux8-4ppy/files/206b7b05-a561-4e69-b4c5-2aaf4edef851,,,,1576,,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/sj3g-dsh3/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/sj3g-dsh3/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/sj3g-dsh3/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/sj3g-dsh3/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD,,,,,,

Surveys were conducted in Zambia and Kenya.

In Kenya, LSTs were identified using the membership roster of the East African Grain Council (EAGC). EAGC is a membership organization that lobbies for grain market integration in east Africa. Its membership roster is considered representative of grain market actors in the region. In total, 26 Kenyan firms registered with EAGC list “trader” as their primary business. Of these, trader surveys were carried out with 18,  including all the multinational traders involved in domestic grain sourcing in Kenya. The remaining 8 firms were either not available or refused to be interviewed for this study. Thus, while not a full census of LSTs in Kenya, the survey captures data from the majority of large-scale firms involved in grain trading.
 
In Zambia, LSTs were identified through Grain Traders Association of Zambia (GTAZ), the primary lobbying organization for grain traders in the country. In total interviews were conducted with 24 managing directors or owners of LST firms in Zambia. This included all multinational firms categorized as “large-scale” in the GTAZ membership roster. Because membership in GTAZ is required to access a trading license in Zambia, we consider this membership roster to include all LSTs in Zambia.

The USAID/Malawi funded program was implemented starting August of 2013, by RTI (Research Triangle Institute) International. The MEGRA educational program was implemented alongside a Feed the Future project called Integrating Nutrition in Value Chains (INVC) and a Global Health Initiative project called Support for Service Delivery Integration (SSDI), both of which were also expected to affect the success of learners in school. Through this interconnected strategy, USAID/Malawi aimed to have a greater impact on outcomes of interest (such as learning reading scores) than would otherwise be possible through one project alone. The key elements of the MEGRA reading intervention involved:

•	Conduct teacher training, including practicums
•	Provide scripted lesson plans to teachers
•	Provide in-service teacher support and mentoring (or coaching)
•	Provide rewards for high-performing teachers and schools
•	Develop and distribute books, story cards, letter cards, and bookshelves
•	Organize reading fairs and other events to engage parents, caregivers, and the community in learner learning
•	Invite parents to participate in their learners’ classrooms and/or become engaged in extracurricular activities
•	Ensure a supportive policy environment by attending the Basic Education Technical Working Group and writing Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) to gain necessary Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology(MoEST) support and buy-in
•	Facilitate the extension of school instructional time

In order to test possible complementary or multiplier effects of the MEGRA reading intervention and the INVC and SSDI activities, all three interventions were implemented in and evaluated for four distinct treatment levels:
•	Treatment Level 1: Three focus districts (Balaka, Machinga, and Lilongwe Rural) that provide an opportunity to evaluate the impact of a fully-integrated development approach with multiple activities across sectors, including MEGRA, INVC, and SSDI, on early grade reading outcomes.
•	Treatment Level 2: The district (Salima) where MEGRA overlaps with only the SSDI intervention. This serves as a test ground for the hypothesis that synergies between education and health initiatives catalyze changes that are greater than the sum of their parts.
•	Treatment Level 3: The district (Ntcheu) where MEGRA overlaps with only the INVC intervention. This serves as a test ground for the development hypothesis that synergies between education and agricultural livelihood and nutrition initiatives catalyze changes that are greater than the sum of their parts.
•	Treatment Level 4: Five districts (Blantyre Rural, Mzimba North, Ntchisi, Thyolo, and Zomba Rural) that only receive the MEGRA initiative. These districts are used to test the MEGRA theory of change that education support leads to improved literacy and general education outcomes.

MEGRA was implemented at the zonal level, at baseline in 2013, where zones were randomly selected in each of the four levels to implement the MEGRA intervention (taking into account areas where INVC and SSDI were already working). However, since INVC and SSDI were not randomly assigned at baseline, the evaluation can only be able to determine whether EGRA is better than no EGRA and whether EGRA plus INVC and SSDI is better than no treatment.

While MEGRA expected to include both treatment and comparison schools in each district at each level, at baseline, it was unable to because the SSDI and INVC activities were already underway. As such, the program found that in the Level 2 district, Salima, it was impossible to select comparison zones that were not already contaminated with the SSDI intervention because SSDI was already working across the entire di",Early Grade Reading Activity Malawi,['184:020'],http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/legalcode,['Basic Education'],vcard:Contact,Lena Knezevic,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,"['https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/sv4k-p9y9/files/56f9ff6f-eeb7-4155-9a4b-85da53f11e36', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/sv4k-p9y9/files/e76e48bb-107b-453f-806d-24b81d4c36b3', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/sv4k-p9y9/files/f82ab712-eb50-4f02-ae5f-3fba48743734', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/sv4k-p9y9/files/7333ad1a-ed28-492d-b435-4521e554c431', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/sv4k-p9y9/files/ac24c93b-5cbe-4994-a35d-60af0833ba0c', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/sv4k-p9y9/files/822d38c5-b775-44ac-8dda-95496621225d']",,,,,1594,https://data.usaid.gov/d/23jf-ca8a,,,,,,,,,,

Both evaluations utilize a mixed-methods, randomized control trial (RCT) approach to provide quantitative estimates of project impact as well as qualitative data regarding the lived experiences of beneficiaries. Both studies answer the “proof-of-concept” question: to what extent does participation in and completion of the A Ganar program increase the likelihood that youth will obtain and maintain jobs, return to school, start their own business or reduce risky behavior? It is important to note that reduction in risk behavior was not an objective of the A Ganar program, but USAID added this metric because A Ganar was working in high violence contexts and wanted to understand programmatic effects on violent/risky behaviors. Additionally, by comparing A Ganar to similar non-sports programs, the Guatemala evaluation explores whether or not sport provides additional benefits to workforce development programming. This submission contains baseline, midline, and endline data from both countries where the program was implemented, in Guatemala and Honduras.

The A Ganar program hypotheses was tested through a rigorous five-year RCT. The target population for the intervention is at-risk youth living in Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula, Guatemala City and surrounding areas. Data was collected from six cohorts (two pilot cohorts and four evaluation cohorts), each surveyed at three distinct times between 2013 – 2016: (1) a baseline completed within two weeks of the final application interview, (2) an immediate post-program follow-up, and (3) an endline occurring 18 months after program completion. Excluding the pilot cohorts, the total sample size for the study is 3,070 respondents (1,219 in Guatemala and 1,851 in Honduras). Randomized assignment was conducted at the individual level within each local implementing organization (IO) resulting in three groups: 1,389 treatment youth (A Ganar), 410 comparison program youth (non-sports), and 1,271 control youth (no program). For endline, an attempt was made to survey all 3,070 youth.

This study thus aimed to characterize the occurrence of genetic reassortment between the MP-12 strain and bunyavirus species closely related to RVFV. The Arumowot virus (AMTV) and Gouleako goukovirus (GOLV), are transmitted by mosquitoes in Africa. The results of this study showed that GOLV does not form detectable reassortant strains with the MP-12 strain in co-infected C6/36 cells. The AMTV also did not form any reassortant strains with MP-12 strain in co-infected C6/36 cells, due to the incompatibility among N, L, and Gn/Gc proteins. A lack of reassortant formation could be due to a functional incompatibility of N and L proteins derived from heterologous species, and due to a lack of packaging via heterologous Gn/Gc proteins. The MP-12 strain did, however, randomly exchange L-, M-, and S-segments with a genetic variant strain, rMP12-GM50, in culture cells. The MP-12 strain is thus unlikely to form any reassortant strains with AMTV or GOLV in nature.

In fiscal year 2012, USAID's Office of Food for Peace (FFP) awarded funding to private voluntary organizations (PVOs) to design and implement a multi-year Title II development food assistance program in Uganda.  The main purpose of the Title II program is to improve long-term food security of chronically food insecure population in the target regions.  FFP contracted a firm, ICF International to conduct a baseline study in targeted areas of the country prior to the start of the new program.  The purpose of the study was to assess the current status of key indicators, have a better understanding of prevailing conditions and perceptions of the population in the implementation areas, and serve as a point of comparison for future final evaluations.  Results would also be used to further refine program targeting and, where possible, to understand the relationship between variables to inform program design.  The study was conducted in 2013, while FFP expects to conduct final evaluations as close as possible to the end of the program five years later.

Each year of implementation, Njira conducted an annual beneficiary-based survey to assess whether the project was on track for achieving the intended outcomes for direct beneficiaries. Survey results were utilized to inform program performance, adjust interventions where appropriate, and meet donor reporting requirements.

Since the discovery of RVF as the cause of an outbreak among sheep and humans during the early 1930s in the Rift Valley in Kenya, the disease has emerged as one of the most important zoonoses in Africa. The disease has and continues to affect the health of thousands to millions of humans and animals, and the livestock industry has lost millions of dollars, and therefore, affecting hundreds of millions of those whose livelihood depends on livestock, exaggerating poverty on already deprived communities.

More particularly, in Northern Ghana three regions were chosen for the study: the Northern, Upper-East and Upper-West regions. These areas cover both maize-based and rice/vegetables-based systems and therefore allow to address the production constraints characterizing both realities. As IFPRI (2012) highlights, the northern regions of Ghana are characterized by small land holdings and low input / low output farming systems, which adversely impact food security. In particular, they are subject to a seasonal cycle of food insecurity of three to seven months for cereals (i.e., maize, millet and sorghum) and four to seven months for legumes (i.e., groundnuts, cowpeas, and soybeans). These crops in the savannahs are often produced in a continuous monoculture, steadily depleting the soil's natural resources and causing the yields per unit area to fall to very low levels. The poverty profile of Ghana identifies the three northern regions as the poorest and most hunger-stricken areas in the country.

Seed size varies widely among different cowpea accessions, and the genetic basis of such variation is not yet well understood. To better decipher the genetic basis of seed size, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and meta-analysis were conducted on a panel of 368 cowpea diverse accessions from 51 countries. Four traits, including seed weight, length, width and density were evaluated across three locations. Using 51,128 single nucleotide polymorphisms covering the cowpea genome, 17 loci were identified for these traits. One locus was common to weight, width and length, suggesting pleiotropy. By integrating synteny-based analysis with common bean, six candidate genes (Vigun05g036000, Vigun05g039600, Vigun05g204200, Vigun08g217000, Vigun11g187000, and Vigun11g191300) which are implicated in multiple functional categories related to seed size such as endosperm development, embryo development, and cell elongation were identified.

The purpose of this project was to address emergency needs of internally displaced persons (IDPs) who have fled violence and settled in Bentiu PoC, Rubkona County in Unity State and Fangak Counties in Jonglei State, as well as other conflict-affected populations in those areas. The emergency health and nutrition activities were implemented in both places, WASH was implemented in Fangak.
The Health sector supported a primary healthcare center (PHCC) in Sector two of the Bentiu PoC and two primary healthcare units (PHCUs) in Fangak County, at Wicmuon and Tiep. The health facilities provided basic health services focusing on reproductive, maternal and child health services, immunization and health education programs, including capacity building activities for health facility staff, the trained community midwives, community health workers (CHWs) and Community Health Promoters (CHPs). 
The Nutrition sector implemented Management of Acute Malnutrition (MAM) services by providing screening, treatment, referral services for severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and MAM cases, including follow-up services for malnourished children under five years of age and the malnourished pregnant and lactating women. 
The Nutrition sector also implemented Infant and Young Child Feeding in Emergencies (IYCF-E), community education focusing on feeding practices for infants and young children and behavior change for mothers and caretakers. WRSS worked with the local community structures consisting of community nutrition volunteers (CNVs) and mothers’ support groups (MSGs). The project provided training/ refreshers training on MAM and IYCF-E aligning with national guidelines. 
WASH activities focused on hygiene promotion activities where both Community Hygiene Committees and Water User Committees (WUCs) were trained and moved house-to-house promoting health and hygiene messages. They also conducted hygiene promotion campaigns which included handwashing and jerrycan cleaning demonstrations. WASH was also integrated with nutrition and health by ensuring availability of WASH infrastructure in facilities like handwashing stations, sanitation and waste management apparatus.
This knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) survey was conducted between 14th and 28th February, 2019. A total of 974 mothers and caregivers of children 0-23.99 months were interviewed through semi-structured household questionnaire and 49 through Focused Group Discussions (FGDs). The purpose of the KAP survey was to identify and assess key issues of the project, to obtain data for key indicators and to inform the future project interventions with regard to health, nutrition and WASH so as to implement approaches that increase access to high quality services.

Today, IDIN Network members and partners continue to support innovators and entrepreneurs around the globe to design, develop, and disseminate technologies to improve the lives of people living in poverty. 

The IDIN Network is made up of more than 1,000 dynamic innovators from around the world who all share a common experience: attending an International Development Design Summit to create technologies with communities in developing countries.

After a design summit, Network members pursued innovative projects, some from a summit and some of their own creation. With access to funding, training, mentorship, and workshop space, these innovators’ prototypes became products designed to make a difference.

What We Do
The IDIN program supported local innovation to create impact in five ways:

1. Design Summits – Hands-on design experiences co-creating low-cost, practical technologies for people living in poverty 
2. IDIN Network Resources – Funding, training, and educational opportunities to support our 1,000+ Network members around the world
3. Innovation Centers – Maker spaces connecting innovators to resources and training to develop technologies that make a social impact
4. Research – A team generating new knowledge on local innovation and the role it plays in sustainable and community development
5. Student Participation – Classes, projects, research, field visits, and technology development to train the next generation of innovators",International Development Innovation Network (IDIN),['184:029__184:031__184:018__184:020__184:021'],,['Higher Education'],vcard:Contact,Lena Knezevic,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,,,,,,1874,https://data.usaid.gov/Higher-Education/International-Development-Innovation-Network-IDIN-/n7pi-wct7,,,,,,,,,,

Each bacteriophage was exposed to 0.1% and 0.5% NaOCl for 1, 5, and 10 minutes on stainless steel. MS2 and M13 were only reduced by 3.4 log and 3.5 log after a 10-­minute exposure to 0.5% NaOCl, and would be overly conservative surrogates. Conversely, PR772 was too easily inactivated for surrogate use, as it was reduced by >4.8 log after only 1­-minute exposure to 0.5% NaOCl. Phi6 was slightly more resistant than the Ebola virus, with 4.1 log reduction after a 5­-minute exposure and not detected after a 10-­minute exposure to 0.5% NaOCl. We therefore recommend

Five questions evaluated increases in access and utilization of reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health interventions; gender-transformative strategies; sustainability; the program’s learning agenda vis-à-vis the Nigerian government’s learning needs; and use of program data.
The evaluation team used a retrospective analytic and a cross-sectional design to address the five questions, and mixed methods were used for data collection, including reviews of the national District Health Information System (DHIS) 2, MCSP-MNCH datasets, and 51 program documents.
Apparent improvements were noted in the utilization of six interventions: oxytocin, partograph, Chlorhexidine 4% gel, newborn resuscitation, essential newborn care, and integrated Community Case Management, particularly with referral of danger signs. MCSP-MNCH baseline data was not available nor calculable for magnesium sulphate or Kangaroo Mother Care. Data was also not available for postpartum family planning for first-time parents and Bubble Continuous Positive Airway Pressure for newborn resuscitation, as a study was undergoing analysis and data was not ready. Furthermore, the dataset MCSP-MNCH provided to the evaluation team was incomplete, imprecise, and contained errors, raising concerns about noted improvements.
The program’s work in male engagement and Mothers Savings and Loans Clubs hold promise for transforming gender norms but reached too few people. Most of the program’s reproductive health and MNCH interventions are likely to be included in budgets in Ebonyi and Kogi through the World Bank’s Saving One Million Lives project, but without specific commitment from the states’ governors, funding release may be jeopardized. The learning agenda helped inform implementation, but the government did not help shape the research. Last, MCSP-MNCH project created a new DHIS database instance for its project data only, including new indicators that it introduced (like application of Chlorhexidine 4% gel for newborn cord care), as well as indicators that were already available in the national DHIS 2 database; it is housed within the same server as the national DHIS 2.",Nigeria MCSP-MNCH Endline Evaluation,['184:017__184:016__184:037'],,['Maternal and Child Health'],vcard:Contact,Janet Fennema,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,"['https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/xy3c-3gvd/files/1dd7d3a3-e5de-4ae7-be21-21c8d9226baa', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/xy3c-3gvd/files/e458fe11-0d5c-4843-86f4-bd8a0477a8aa', 'https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/xy3c-3gvd/files/7ee9ce09-9ea9-4bba-8c73-cb09a15e3e08']",https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/xy3c-3gvd/files/2657bb5b-7357-429e-b8ae-b5123edf82fa,,,,1926,https://data.usaid.gov/d/9bie-z8ei,,,,,,,,,,

It has 34 columns and 4,766 rows.  In fiscal year 2012, USAID's Office of Food for Peace (FFP) awarded funding to private voluntary organizations (PVOs) to design and implement a multi-year Title II development food assistance program in Uganda.  The main purpose of the Title II program is to improve long-term food security of chronically food insecure population in the target regions.  FFP contracted a firm, ICF International to conduct a baseline study in targeted areas of the country prior to the start of the new program.  The purpose of the study was to assess the current status of key indicators, have a better understanding of prevailing conditions and perceptions of the population in the implementation areas, and serve as a point of comparison for future final evaluations.  Results would also be used to further refine program targeting and, where possible, to understand the relationship between variables to inform program design.  The study was conducted in 2013, while FFP expects to conduct final evaluations as close as possible to the end of the program five years later.  The data asset is comprised of six datasets: 1) a description of all members of the households surveyed, 2) data on maternal health and sanitation practices, 3) data about the children in the household, 4) data describing the agricultural practices of the household, 5) data describing the food consumption of the household (broken into 4 smaller spreadsheets), and 6) and a description of the weights that should be applied during the analysis of the other datasets.","Baseline Study of Food for Peace Title II Development Food Assistance Program in Karamoja, Uganda--Sampling Weights","['184:016,184:018,184:019,184:029,184:037']",http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/legalcode,['Humanitarian Assistance'],vcard:Contact,USAID Data Services,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,,,,,,1930,,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/xyzs-rfpg/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/xyzs-rfpg/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/xyzs-rfpg/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/xyzs-rfpg/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD,,,,,,

In preparation for future extensive, large­-scale disinfection efficacy experiments, we replicated the Cook et al. experiment using four potential BSL­-1 surrogates selected based on similarities to the Ebola virus: bacteriophages MS2, M13, Phi6, and PR772. Each bacteriophage was exposed to 0.1% and 0.5% NaOCl for 1, 5, and 10 minutes on stainless steel. MS2 and M13 were only reduced by 3.4 log and 3.5 log after a 10-­minute exposure to 0.5% NaOCl, and would be overly conservative surrogates. Conversely, PR772 was too easily inactivated for surrogate use, as it was reduced by >4.8 log after only 1­-minute exposure to 0.5% NaOCl. Phi6 was slightly more resistant than the Ebola virus, with 4.1 log reduction after a 5­-minute exposure and not detected after a 10-­minute exposure to 0.5% NaOCl. We therefore recommend
Phi6 as a surrogate for evaluating the efficacy of chlorine-­based surface disinfectants against the Ebola virus.",Comparison of four bacteriophages exposed to chlorine on stainless steel: summary data,['184:034'],http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/legalcode,['Other Public Health Threats'],vcard:Contact,Lena Knezevic,mailto:no-reply@data.usaid.gov,org:Organization,data.usaid.gov,,,,,,1949,,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/yd9f-fyz7/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/yd9f-fyz7/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/yd9f-fyz7/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD,https://data.usaid.gov/api/views/yd9f-fyz7/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD,,,,,,

We compared the efficacy of four chlorine solutions (sodium hypochlorite, sodium dichloroisocyanurate, high ­test hypochlorite, and generated hypochlorite) for disinfection of three surface types (stainless steel, heavy duty tarp, and nitrile), with and without pre­cleaning practices (pre­wiping and/or covering) and soil load. The test organisms were E. coli and the Ebola surrogate Phi6. All tests achieved a minimum of 5.9­ and 3.1­log removal in E. coli and Phi6, respectively. A 15­-minute exposure to 0.5% chlorine was sufficient to ensure less than 8 Phi6 PFU/cm2 in all tests. While chlorine types were equally efficacious with and without soil load, variation was seen by surface type.

This midline was conducted by CAMRIS International. The household survey includes questions concerning implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), access to justice, access to government service, service effectiveness and accountability. On broader themes, it captures inclusion and tolerance, peaceful conflict resolution, and participation and governance. 

It carries the themes from the Democratic Human Right and Governance assessment conducted in 2012, describing the main DRG problem in Nepal as a “government effectiveness gap,” in which the Government of Nepal (GON) fails to meet the increasing demands for inclusion.

USAID/Nepal’s first development objective focuses on more inclusive and effective governance. To address this gap and to achieve the objective of effective governance and political inclusion in Nepal, four conditions must be achieved—peace, accountability, civic participation, and better performance. Without peace, human development is not possible, and without human development, peace is not sustainable. The Mission has focused on targeting these conditions at the local level, while pushing for national level accountability and reform to close the government effectiveness gap on the ground. It focuses on key performance indicators from the USAID Nepal Mission Performance Management Plan (PMP). 

Data collection was started from first week of September and completed by mid of October 2017. Interviews were carried out face-to-face with data collected on electronic device among household members aged 18 to 65 years. The answers were based on self-reported response.

Two distinct samples were designed to create a comparison of USAID targeted VDCs and the rest of the nation. The national sample consisted of 786 respondents and the USAID sample consisted of 1208 respondents scattered over 42 districts out of 75.
  
The ward (smallest administrative unit) was the sampling unit. The ward was segmented into 9-12 homogenous clusters. And three out of 9-12 clusters were randomly selected. Following that, a household listing operation was performed. After doing that, households were selected using systematic random sampling.
